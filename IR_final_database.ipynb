It also explains the steps we take to protect your privacy, like building our Services so delivered messages aren’t stored by us and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.\\n\\nWe are one of the Meta Companies. You can learn more further below in this Privacy Policy about the ways in which we share information across this family of companies.\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise.\\n\\nPlease also read WhatsApp’s Terms of Service (\"Terms\"), which describe the terms under which you use and we provide our Services.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nKey Updates\\nRespect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve built our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. In our updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy you’ll find:\\n\\nAdditional Information On How We Handle Your Data. Our updated Terms and Privacy Policy provide more information on how we process your data, and our commitment to privacy. For example, we’ve added more information about more recent product features and functionalities, how we process your data for safety, security, and integrity, and added more direct links to user settings, Help Center articles and how you can manage your information.\\nBetter Communication With Businesses. Many businesses rely on WhatsApp to communicate with their customers and clients. We work with businesses that use Meta or third parties to help store and better manage their communications with you on WhatsApp.\\nMaking It Easier To Connect. As part of the Meta Companies, WhatsApp partners with Meta to offer experiences and integrations across Meta’s family of apps and products.\\nBack to top\\n\\nInformation We Collect\\nWhatsApp must receive or collect some information to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.\\n\\nThe types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We require certain information to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.\\n\\nOur Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot share your location with your contacts if you do not permit us to collect your location data from your device. Permissions can be managed through your Settings menu on both Android and iOS devices.\\n\\nInformation You Provide\\nYour Account Information. You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a WhatsApp account. If you don’t provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. You can add other information to your account, such as a profile picture and \"about\" information.\\nYour Messages. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. The following scenarios describe circumstances where we may store your messages in the course of delivering them:\\nUndelivered Messages. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.\\nMedia Forwarding. When a user forwards media within a message, we store that media temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery of additional forwards.\\n\\nWe offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them. Learn more about end-to-end encryption and how businesses communicate with you on WhatsApp.\\nYour Connections. You can use the contact upload feature and provide us, if permitted by applicable laws, with the phone numbers in your address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information for you in a way that ensures those contacts cannot be identified by us. Learn more about our contact upload feature here. You can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information. You give your groups a name. You can provide a group profile picture or description.\\nStatus Information. You may provide us your status if you choose to include one on your account. Learn how to use status on Android, iPhone, or KaiOS.\\nTransactions And Payments Data. If you use our payments services, or use our Services meant for purchases or other financial transactions, we process additional information about you, including payment account and transaction information. Payment account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the transaction (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and transaction amount). If you use our payments services available in your country or territory, our privacy practices are described in the applicable payments privacy policy.\\nCustomer Support And Other Communications. When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues.\\n\\nAutomatically Collected Information\\nUsage And Log Information. We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you interact with others using our Services (including when you interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, \"about\" information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your \"last seen\"); and when you last updated your \"about\" information.\\nDevice And Connection Information. We collect device and connection-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information (including phone number, mobile operator or ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information, and identifiers (including identifiers unique to Meta Company Products associated with the same device or account).\\nLocation Information. We collect and use precise location information from your device with your permission when you choose to use location-related features, like when you decide to share your location with your contacts or view locations nearby or locations others have shared with you. There are certain settings relating to location-related information which you can find in your device settings or the in-app settings, such as location sharing. Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country). We also use your location information for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes.\\nCookies. We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customize them. For example, we use cookies to provide our Services for web and desktop and other web-based services. We may also use cookies to understand which of our Help Center articles are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services. Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to provide a safer experience, and otherwise to customize our Services for you. Learn more about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nThird-Party Information\\nInformation Others Provide About You. We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number, name, and other information (like information from their mobile address book) just as you may provide theirs. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us.\\nYou should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.\\nUser Reports. Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is made, we collect information on both the reporting user and reported user. To find out more about what happens when a user report is made, please see Advanced Safety and Security Features.\\nBusinesses On WhatsApp. Businesses you interact with using our Services may provide us with information about their interactions with you. We require each of these businesses to act in accordance with applicable law when providing any information to us.\\nWhen you message with a business on WhatsApp, keep in mind that the content you share may be visible to several people in that business. In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers (which may include Meta) to help manage their communications with their customers. For example, a business may give such third-party service provider access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. To understand how a business processes your information, including how it might share your information with third parties or Meta, you should review that business’ privacy policy or contact the business directly.\\nThird-Party Service Providers. We work with third-party service providers and other Meta Companies to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with them to distribute our apps; provide our technical and physical infrastructure, delivery, and other systems; provide engineering support, cybersecurity support, and operational support; supply location, map, and places information; process payments; help us understand how people use our Services; market our Services; help you connect with businesses using our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; ensure safety, security, and integrity; and help with customer service. These companies may provide us with information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us with reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.\\nThe \"How We Work With Other Meta Companies\" section below provides more information about how WhatsApp collects and shares information with the other Meta Companies.\\nThird-Party Services. We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and Meta Company Products. If you use our Services with such third-party services or Meta Company Products, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier’s or device provider’s promotion of our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services or Meta Company Products, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.\\nBack to top\\n\\nHow We Use Information\\nWe use information we have (subject to choices you make and applicable law) to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. Here\\'s how:\\n\\nOur Services. We use information we have to operate and provide our Services, including providing customer support; completing purchases or transactions; improving, fixing, and customizing our Services; and connecting our Services with Meta Company Products that you may use. We also use information we have to understand how people use our Services; evaluate and improve our Services; research, develop, and test new services and features; and conduct troubleshooting activities. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.\\nSafety, Security, And Integrity. Safety, security, and integrity are an integral part of our Services. We use information we have to verify accounts and activity; combat harmful conduct; protect users against bad experiences and spam; and promote safety, security, and integrity on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our Terms and policies, and to ensure our Services are being used legally. Please see the Law, Our Rights and Protection section below for more information.\\nCommunications About Our Services And The Meta Companies. We use information we have to communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our terms, policies, and other important updates. We may provide you marketing for our Services and those of the Meta Companies.\\nNo Third-Party Banner Ads. We still do not allow third-party banner ads on our Services. We have no intention to introduce them, but if we ever do, we will update this Privacy Policy.\\nBusiness Interactions. We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate and interact with each other using our Services, such as Catalogs for businesses on WhatsApp through which you can browse products and services and place orders. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you receive from a business could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.\\nBack to top\\n\\nInformation You And We Share\\nYou share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.\\n\\nSend Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate. You share your information (including messages) as you use and communicate through our Services.\\nInformation Associated With Your Account. Your phone number, profile name and photo, \"about\" information, last seen information, and message receipts are available to anyone who uses our Services, although you can configure your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users, including businesses, with whom you communicate.\\nYour Contacts And Others. Users, including businesses, with whom you communicate can store or reshare your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Services. You can use your Services settings and the “block” feature in our Services to manage who you communicate with on our Services and certain information you share.\\nBusinesses On WhatsApp. We offer specific services to businesses such as providing them with metrics regarding their use of our Services.\\nThird-Party Service Providers. We work with third-party service providers and other Meta Companies to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. We work with these companies to support our Services, such as to provide technical infrastructure, delivery and other systems; market our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; protect the safety, security, and integrity of users and others; and assist with customer service. When we share information with third-party service providers and other Meta Companies in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.\\nThird-Party Services. When you or others use third-party services or other Meta Company Products that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Drive), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages. If you interact with a third-party service or another Meta Company Product linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or Meta Company Product. Please note that when you use third-party services or other Meta Company Products, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.\\nBack to top\\n\\nHow We Work With Other Meta Companies\\nAs part of the Meta Companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information (see here) with, the other Meta Companies. We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings, including the Meta Company Products. This includes:\\n\\nhelping improve infrastructure and delivery systems;\\nunderstanding how our Services or theirs are used;\\npromoting safety, security, and integrity across the Meta Company Products, e.g., securing systems and fighting spam, threats, abuse, or infringement activities;\\nimproving their services and your experiences using them, such as making suggestions for you (for example, of friends or group connections, or of interesting content), personalizing features and content, helping you complete purchases and transactions, and showing relevant offers and ads across the Meta Company Products; and\\nproviding integrations which enable you to connect your WhatsApp experiences with other Meta Company Products. For example, allowing you to connect your Facebook Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp or enabling you to chat with your friends on other Meta Company Products, such as Portal, by connecting your WhatsApp account.\\nLearn more about the other Meta Companies and their privacy practices by reviewing their privacy policies.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nAssignment, Change Of Control, And Transfer\\nIn the event that we are involved in a merger, acquisition, restructuring, bankruptcy, or sale of all or some of our assets, we will share your information with the successor entities or new owners in connection with the transaction in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nManaging And Retaining Your Information\\nYou can access or port your information using our in-app Request Account Info feature (available under Settings > Account). For iPhone users, you can learn how to access, manage, and delete your information through our iPhone Help Center articles. For Android users, you can learn how to access, manage, and delete your information through our Android Help Center articles.\\n\\nWe store information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, including to provide our Services or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal obligations.\\n\\nIf you would like to further manage, change, limit, or delete your information, you can do that through the following tools:\\n\\nServices Settings. You can change your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users. You can manage your contacts, groups, and broadcast lists, or use our “block” feature to manage the users with whom you communicate.\\nChanging Your Mobile Phone Number, Profile Name And Picture, And “About” Information. If you change your mobile phone number, you must update it using our in-app change number feature and transfer your account to your new mobile phone number. You can also change your profile name, profile picture, and \"about\" information at any time.\\nDeleting Your WhatsApp Account. You can delete your WhatsApp account at any time (including if you want to revoke your consent to our use of your information pursuant to applicable law) using our in-app delete my account feature. When you delete your WhatsApp account, your undelivered messages are deleted from our servers as well as any of your other information we no longer need to operate and provide our Services.

Our products and services — including Snapchat, Bitmoji, Spectacles advertising, commerce and others that link to this Privacy Policy — provide fast and fun ways to express yourself, live at the moment, learn about the world and have fun together!\\nWhen you use these services, you’ll share some information with us. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with and the controls we give you to access, update and delete your information.\\nThat’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. And it's why we've tried to write it in a way that's easy to understand for all our users and blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us.\\nYou should read our entire Privacy Policy, but when you only have a few minutes or want to remember something later on, you can always take a look at this overview and video. We also encourage you to check out the rest of our Privacy Center. We designed it to give you easy-to-digest summaries of our privacy practices. For example, our Privacy by Product page provides a breakdown of specific privacy features for our products.\\nInformation we collect\\nThere are 3 basic categories of information we collect:\\nInformation you provide.\\nInformation we get when you use our services.\\nInformation we get from third parties.\\nHere’s a little more detail on each of these categories.\\nInformation you provide\\nWhen you interact with our services, we collect information that you provide to us. For example, many of our services require you to set up an account, so we may need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, phone number and date of birth. We may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a profile picture or Bitmoji avatar. Some services, such as commerce products, may require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.\\nOf course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through our services, such as Snaps and Chats. Keep in mind that the users who view your Snaps, Chats and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to our services as well: Don't send messages or share content that you wouldn't want someone to save or share.\\nWhen you contact customer support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.\\nInformation we get when you use our services\\nWhen you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Story, saw a specific advertisement for a certain period of time and sent a few Snaps. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:\\nUsage Information. We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:\\nHow you interact with our services, such as which Filters or Lenses you view or apply to Snaps, which Stories you watch on Discover, whether you're using Spectacles or which search queries you submit.\\nHow you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).\\nContent information. We collect content you create on our services, such as custom stickers, and information about the content you create or provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.\\nDevice information. We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we collect:\\ninformation about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, device usage data, browser type, keyboards installed, language, battery level and time zone;\\ninformation from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones and headphone connection; and\\ninformation about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address and signal strength.\\nDevice phone book. Because our services are all about communicating with friends, we may – with your permission – collect information from your device's phone book.\\nCamera, photos and audio. Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to send Snaps or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.\\nLocation information. When you use our services, we may collect information about your location. With your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, mobile towers, Wi-Fi access points and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses.\\nInformation collected by cookies and other technologies. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies such as web beacons, web storage and unique advertising identifiers to collect information about your activity, browser and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as advertising and commerce features. For example, we may use information collected on other websites to show you more relevant advertisements. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we and our partners use cookies on our services and your choices, please check out our Cookie Policy.\\nLog information. We also collect log information when you use our website, such as:\\ndetails about how you’ve used our services;\\ndevice information, such as your web browser type and language;\\naccess times;\\npages viewed;\\nIP address;\\nIdentifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser; and\\nPages you visit before or after navigating to our website.\\nInformation we collect from third parties\\nWe may collect information about you from other users, our affiliates, and third parties. Here are a few examples:\\nIf you link your Snapchat account to another service (like Bitmoji or a third-party app), we may receive information from the other service, like how you use that service.\\nAdvertisers, app developers, publishers and other third parties may share information with us as well. We may use this information, among other ways, to help target or measure the performance of adverts. You can learn more about our use of this kind of third-party data in our Support Center.\\nIf another user uploads their contact list, we may combine information from that user’s contact list with other information we have collected about you.\\nHow we use information\\nWhat do we do with the information we collect? For the detailed answer, go here. The short answer is: provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we improve relentlessly. Here are the ways we do that:\\nDevelop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain and protect our products and services.\\nSend you communications, including by email or SMS where permitted. For example, we may use email or SMS to respond to support enquiries or to share information about our products, services and promotional offers that we think may interest you.\\nMonitor and analyse trends and usage.\\npersonalize our services by, among other things, suggesting friends, profile information, or Bitmoji stickers, helping Snapchatters find each other in Snapchat, affiliate and third-party apps and services, or customising the content we show you, including ads.\\nAdd context to your Snapchat experience, for example by tagging your Memories with searchable labels based on your location (of course, if you've given us permission to collect your location) and the content of your photo or video (e.g., if there's a dog in your photo, it may be searchable in Memories under the term “dog”).\\nProvide and improve our advertising services, ad targeting and ad measurement, including through the use of your precise location information (again, if you’ve given us permission to collect that information), both on and off our services. We may also store information about your use of third-party apps and websites on your device to do this. Learn more. See the Control Over Your Information section below for more information about Snap Inc.’s advertising practices and your choices.\\nEnhance the safety and security of our products and services.\\nverify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorised or illegal activity.\\nUse information we’ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance our services and your experience with them.\\nEnforce, investigate and report conduct violating our Terms of Service and other usage policies, respond to requests from law enforcement and comply with legal requirements.\\nWe may also use information from Apple’s TrueDepth camera to improve the quality of Lenses. Information from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time — we don't store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.\\nHow we share information\\nWe may share information about you in the following ways:\\nWith other Snapchatters. We may share the following information with other Snapchatters:\\nInformation about you, such as your username, name and Bitmoji.\\nInformation about how you have interacted with our services, such as your Snapchat “score”, the names of Snapchatters you are friends with, how close you are with your friends on Snapchat, your recent location history (if you choose to share your location on Snap Map) and other information that will help Snapchatters understand your connections with others using our services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requester have Snapchat friends in common.\\nInformation about your device, such as the operating system and device type, to help you receive Chats, Snaps and other content in the optimal viewing format.\\nAny additional information you have directed us to share. For example, Snap will share your information when you connect your Snapchat account to a third-party app and if you share information or content from Snapchat to the third-party app.\\nContent you post or send. How widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using. For example, a Snap may be sent to just a single friend you select, but your My Story content may be seen by any Snapchatter whom you allow to see your My Story.\\nWith all Snapchatters, our business partners and the general public. We may share the following information with all Snapchatters, as well as with our business partners and the public:\\nPublic information like your name, username, profile pictures, Snapcode and Public Profile.\\nPublic content like your Highlights, Custom Stickers, Lenses, Story submissions that are set to be viewable by Everyone and any content that you submit to an inherently public service, like Spotlight, Snap Map and other crowdsourced services. This content may be viewed, used and shared by the public at large both on and off our services, including through search results, on websites, in apps and in online and offline broadcasts.\\nWith our affiliates. We may share information with entities within the Snap Inc. family of companies.\\nWith third parties. We may share information with third parties in the following ways:\\nWe may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, including to facilitate payments and measure and optimize the performance of ads and deliver more relevant ads, including on third-party websites and apps.\\nWe may share information about you with business partners that provide services and functionality on our services. For more information about information collected by third parties on our services, visit our Support Site.\\nWe may share information about you, such as device and usage information, to help us and others prevent fraud.\\nWe may share information about you for legal, safety and security reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:\\nComply with any valid legal processing, governmental request or applicable law, rule or regulation.\\nInvestigate, remedy or enforce potential Terms of Service and Community Guidelines violations.\\nProtect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others.\\nDetect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.\\nWe may share information about you as part of a merger or acquisition. If Snap Inc. gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.\\nNon-personal information. We may also share aggregated, non-personally identifiable or de-identified information with third parties that provide services to us or perform business purposes for us.\\nThird-party content and integrations\\nOur services may contain third-party content and integrations. Examples include third-party integrations in the Camera, third-party games in Chat and third-party Snap Kit integrations. Through these integrations, you may be providing information to the third party as well as to Snap. We are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services. You can learn more about third-party services in Snapchat here.\\nHow long we keep your information\\nSnapchat lets you capture what it’s like to live in the moment. On our end, that means most messages — like Snaps and Chats — sent in Snapchat will be automatically deleted by default from our servers after we detect they've been opened by all recipients or have expired. Other content, like Story posts, are stored for longer. For detailed information about how long we store different types of content, check out our Support Site.\\nWe store other information for longer periods of time. For example:\\nWe store your basic account information — like your name, phone number and email address — and list of friends until you ask us to delete them.\\nWe store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which services you use. If location information is associated with a Snap — like those saved to Memories or posted to Snap Map or Spotlight — we'll retain that location as long as we store the Snap. Expert tip: you can see the location data we retain about you by downloading your data.\\nIf you ever decide to stop using Snapchat, you can just ask us to delete your account. We’ll also delete most of the information we’ve collected about you after you’ve been inactive for a while!\\nKeep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific time frame. There may be legal requirements to store your data, and we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your account, content created by you or content created with other users is flagged by others or our systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.\\nControl over your information\\nWe want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.\\nAccess, Correction, and Portability. You can access and edit most of your basic account information right in our apps. You can also use Download My Data to obtain a copy of information that isn’t available in our apps in a portable format, so you can move it or store it wherever you want. Because your privacy is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We may also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a number of reasons, including, for example, if the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful.\\nRevoking permissions. In most cases, if you let us use your information, you can simply revoke your permission by changing the settings in the app or on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality. For promotional emails and SMS, you may opt out by clicking on the unsubscribe link or similar mechanism as provided.\\nDeletion. While we hope you’ll remain a lifelong Snapchatter, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go here to learn how. You can also delete some information in the app, like photos you’ve saved to Memories, Spotlight submissions and search history.\\nAdvertising preferences. We try to show you advertisements that we think will be relevant to your interests. If you would like to modify the information we and our advertising partners use to select these advertisements, you can do so in the app and through your device preferences. Go here to learn more.\\nTracking. If you opt out of tracking on devices running iOS 14.5 or more recent versions, we will not link identifiable information from third-party apps and websites with identifiable information from Snapchat for advertising purposes, except on your device. You can control use of this on-device data for advertising by opting out of Activity-Based Advertising in Snapchat Ad Preferences Settings. Go here to learn more.\\nCommunicating with other Snapchatters. It’s important to us that you stay in control over whom you communicate with. That’s why we’ve built a number of tools in Settings that let you indicate, among other things, who you want to see your Stories, whether you’d like to receive Snaps from just your friends or all Snapchatters and whether you’d like to block another Snapchatter from contacting you again. Go here to learn more.\\nInternational data transfers\\nWe may collect your personal information from, transfer it to and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live. Whenever we share information outside of where you live, when we are legally required to do so, we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place. We also make sure any third parties we share information with have an adequate transfer mechanism in place, as well. You can find more information on the categories of third parties we share information with here.\\nState and region specific information\\nYou may have specific privacy rights in your state or region. For example, in the United States, residents of California and other states have specific privacy rights. Snapchatters in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, Brazil, the Republic of Korea and other jurisdictions also have specific rights. We keep an up-to-date overview of state and region specific disclosures here.\\nChildren\\nOur services are not intended for - and we don't direct them to - anyone under the age of 13. That's why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. In addition, we may limit how we collect, use and store some of the information of EEA and UK users between the ages of 13 and 16. In some cases, this means we will be unable to provide certain functionality to these users. If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent’s consent before we collect and use that information.\\nRevisions to the Privacy Policy\\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that’s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ home pages or providing you with an in-app notification).\\nCompany\\nSnap Inc.\\nCareers\\nNews\\nPrivacy and Safety\\nCommunity\\nSnapchat Support\\nPixy Support\\nCommunity Guidelines\\nAdvertising\\nBuy Ads\\nAdvertising Policies\\nPolitical Ads Library\\nBrand Guidelines\\nPromotions Rules\\nLegal\\nSnap Terms\\nLaw Enforcement\\nCookie Policy\\nCookie Settings\\nReport infringement\\nPrivacy Policy\\nTerms of Service\\nLanguage\\nEnglish (UK)\\n\", 0)\n",

Changes to this Privacy Policy\\n12. Questions and concerns\\nTelegram Privacy Policy\\n1. Introduction\\nThis Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc. (“Telegram”), use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the “Services”). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to Telegram, and ‘you’ refers to you, the user of the Services.\\n\\n1.1 Privacy Principles\\nTelegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:\\n\\nWe don't use your data to show you ads.\\nWe only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.\\n1.2. Terms of Service\\nThis Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at https://telegram.org/tos. This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.\\n\\n1.3. Table of Contents\\nThis Privacy Policy explains the following:\\n\\nthe legal basis for processing your personal data;\\nwhat personal data we may collect from you;\\nhow we keep your personal data safe;\\nwhat we may use your personal data for;\\nwho your personal data may be shared with; and\\nyour rights regarding your personal data.\\n1.4. EEA Representative\\nIf you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services. However, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\\n\\n2. Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\\nWe process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: (1) providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.\\n\\n3. What Personal Data We Use\\n3.1. Basic Account Data\\nTelegram is a communication service. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.\\n\\nTo make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public. We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\\n\\nWe do not require your screen name to be your real name. Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name. This way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).\\n\\n3.2. Your Email Address\\nWhen you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.\\n\\nFrom September 2022, we may ask some users to provide an email address to receive login codes via email instead of SMS (with an option to use 'Sign in With Google' / 'Sign in with Apple'). In this case, we will receive an email address which will be stored separately from the recovery email, and will only be used to send you authentication codes when you log in to your account. The login email address will be stored until it is changed or the account is deleted.\\n\\n3.3. Your Messages\\n3.3.1. Cloud Chats\\nTelegram is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups. All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.\\n\\n3.3.2. Secret Chats\\nSecret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats. For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.\\n\\n3.3.3. Media in Secret Chats\\nWhen you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. They can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.\\n\\n3.3.4. Public Chats\\nIn addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups. All public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above). Like everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.\\n\\n3.4. Phone Number and Contacts\\nTelegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.\\n\\nWe store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.\\n\\nOur automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the approximate number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram. When you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\\n\\nYou can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings.\\n\\nIf you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG). If you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code. Telegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.\\n\\n3.5. Location Data\\nIf you share a location in a chat, this location data is treated like other messages in cloud or secret chats respectively.\\n\\nIf you share your Live Location in any chat or turn on ’Make Myself Visible’ in People Nearby, Telegram will use your data to display your location to those users with whom you are sharing it, even when the app is closed – for as long as you keep these optional features activated.\\n\\n3.6. Cookies\\nThe only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web. We do not use cookies for profiling or advertising. The cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience. Your browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.\\n\\n4. Keeping Your Personal Data Safe\\n4.1. Storing Data\\nIf you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands. These are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space. However, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram. As such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers. All data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.\\n\\n4.2. End-to-End Encrypted Data\\nYour messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient. Before this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient. While Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information. In this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.\\n\\n4.3. Retention\\nUnless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.\\n\\n5. Processing Your Personal Data\\n5.1. Our Services\\nTelegram is a cloud service. We will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.\\n\\n5.2. Safety and Security\\nTelegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations. Telegram also has more than 700 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers. To improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc. If collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.\\n\\n5.3. Spam and Abuse\\nTo prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients. If a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently. You can send an appeal using @Spambot. In case of more serious violations, your account may be banned. We may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.\\n\\n5.4. Cross-Device Functionality\\nWe may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.\\n\\n5.5. Advanced features\\nWe may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features. For example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen. To do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently. A similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”). To turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.\\n\\n5.6. No Ads Based on User Data\\nUnlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes. Telegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\\n\\nTelegram offers a tool for advertisers to promote their messages in public one-to-many channels, but these sponsored messages are based solely on the topic of the public channels in which they are shown. No user data is mined or analyzed to display ads or sponsored messages.\\n\\n6. Bot Messages\\n6.1. Ecosystem\\nTelegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots. Bots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features. By performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.\\n\\n6.2. How Bots Can Receive Data\\nYou can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:\\n\\nBy sending messages to a bot.\\nBy using an inline bot.\\nBy participating in a group with a bot.\\nBy pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.\\nBy paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).\\n6.3. What Data Bots Receive\\nIn any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).\\n\\nBots can also receive the following data when you interact with them.\\n\\nBots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.\\nIf you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\\nIf the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.\\nWhen you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g. @gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot. This query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service. We will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.\\nBots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access. If the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group. The interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.\\n6.4. Bots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\\nOther than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram. They are completely independent from us. They should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.\\n\\n7. Third Party Payment Services\\n7.1. Payment Information\\nThe Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0. Telegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world. It is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details. Neither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information. Although we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram. Please study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\\n\\n7.2. Credit Card Information\\nWhen making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server. Your credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers. We do not access and do not store your credit card information. When you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a token that you can reuse for future payments. It is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.\\n\\n7.3 Shipping Information\\nWhen you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer. We can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases. We will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.\\n\\n7.4. Clearing Payment Information\\nYou can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment & Shipping Info’. If you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.\\n\\n7.5. Payment Disputes\\nDue to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.\\n\\n8. Who Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\\n8.1. Other Telegram Users\\nOther users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA. Note that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\\n\\n8.2. Telegram’s Group Companies\\nWe may share your personal data with: (1) our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands; and (2) Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services. We will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data. This will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies. If you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.\\n\\n8.3. Law Enforcement Authorities\\nIf Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities. So far, this has never happened. When it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.\\n\\n8.4. Translation of Chats, Channels and specific Messages at the Request of the User\\nUsers can choose to translate a specific text message into a different language by tapping “Translate” in the action menu of the message (to enable this option, a user should first turn on Translation services in the Settings > Languages section of the Telegram application). Telegram Premium users can also optionally enable automatic live translation on any chat, group or channel.\\n\\nSince Telegram may rely on a third-party, Google LLC, subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, for automatic translation of messages, the text of any message or set of messages that users choose to translate may be shared with Google in order to obtain their translated versions. Google will only access the data to provide a translation and will not use it for any other Google products, services, or advertising.\\n\\n8.5. Transcription of Voice and Video Messages at the Request of the User\\nSome users can choose to convert a voice or video message to text by tapping on the Voice-to-Text icon (“->A”) displayed on eligible messages (to be able to use this option, users should subscribe to Telegram Premium in the Settings > Telegram Premium section of the Telegram application).\\n\\nSince Telegram may rely on a third party, Google LLC, subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, for voice-to-text conversion, the audio data of voice and video messages that users choose to convert to text may be shared with Google in order to obtain their transcribed versions. Only audio data may be shared for this purpose (no other data, such as the user's IP address or any information about their account is shared). According to the agreement between Telegram and Google, Telegram will pay for the transcriptions on behalf of its users and Google will only access the audio data to provide a transcribed version – it will not log audio data or transcripts, and will not use the data for any other Google products, services, or advertising.\\n\\n9. Your Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\\n9.1. Your Rights\\nUnder applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data. You have a right to: (1) request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller; (2) delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data; (3) restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data; (4) correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you; and (5) lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.\\n\\n9.2. Exercising Your Rights\\nIf you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.\\n\\n9.3. Data Settings\\nYou can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings (using one of our mobile apps).\\n\\nSadly, if you're not OK with Telegram's modest minimum requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services. You can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.\\n\\n10. Deleting data\\n10.1. Accounts\\nIf you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.\\n\\n10.2. Messages\\nIn secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.\\nIn cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending. Otherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history. This means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.\\nAs of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides. There is no time limit. Any party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, regardless of how many messages are retained by either of the participants.\\nIn supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants. Note that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.\\n10.3. Self-Destructing Messages\\nMessages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct. As soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts. When the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.). Media with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews. The timer is triggered when they are viewed.\\n\\n10.4. Account Self-Destruction\\nBy default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. You can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.\\n\\n11. Changes to this Privacy Policy\\nWe will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page www.telegram.org/privacy. Please check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\\n\\nMarch 25, 2019\\n\\nExpanded [10.2.

Stay for what you discover.\\nPosted by fatchance\\nSearch Tumblr\\nTermsCopyrightPrivacyGuidelinesGlobal Advertising\\nPrivacy Policy\\nLast Modified: 2022-12-30\\nThe original version of this Privacy Policy is written in English. To the extent any translated version of this Privacy Policy conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\\nTumblr, Inc. (\"Tumblr,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") takes the private nature of your information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the \"Privacy Policy\") describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use tumblr.com (the \"Site\") and/or Tumblr\\'s other domains, products, advertising products, services, and/or content, including our iOS and Android mobile applications (collectively with the Site, the \"Services\"). Tumblr is a subsidiary of Automattic, a technology company that empowers people to build beautiful websites, tell their stories, and find and grow their audience. The way we handle your information hasn’t changed, so this Privacy Policy still governs when you are on Tumblr, using a Tumblr app or interacting with our products, services or technologies. We may share non-personal information with our family companies for purposes such as product improvements, research and analysis, and to help them provide you with more relevant experiences. When you use the Services, you also consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.\\n\\nWhat This Privacy Policy Covers\\nThis Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners.\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, or businesses (“Third Party Services”). This includes third parties you provide with information about yourself as part of enabling or using a Tumblr feature, for example, information you provide to Stripe when interacting with the Post+ or Tipping Feature within Tumblr, or information you provide to The Meet Group as part of Tumblr Live. While we try to work only with those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don\\'t take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.\\n\\nAlso: This Privacy Policy doesn’t govern what our users do on their Tumblr blogs and we aren\\'t responsible for the information collection and use practices of our individual blogs and bloggers. One of the great features of Tumblr\\'s products is customizability, and bloggers have a lot of flexibility in how their blogs behave. When you visit a blog in our network, that blog may collect more information than we do, and may provide information to third parties that we have no relationship with, including to advertisers.\\n\\nWhat We Collect and How We Use It\\nAccount Information: When you create an account on the Services (an \"Account\"), we’ll ask you for information such as your username, password, age, and email address (“Account Information”). We may use Account Information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as by personalization. We use your age to verify that you can lawfully use the Services. We use your email address to verify your Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below. We also allow users to look for their friends by email address; you can, however, opt out of email lookup through your Account Settings.\\n\\nYou can keep yourself fairly anonymous on Tumblr, but remember that your posts, blogs, pages, and username are all visible to the public by default. People that know your email address can also find your blogs. If you’d rather be unlisted, head over to your Account Settings.\\nEmail Communications with Us: As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your Account Settings page or by using the “Opt-Out” link in the emails themselves. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account Information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to us.\\n\\nWe send two kinds of email: ones about fun stuff happening on Tumblr, and ones with important information about your account. You can opt out of the former, but not the latter.\\nInformation about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: You can link your Account to certain Third Party Services. In order to do so, you may provide us with your username or other user ID for a Third Party Service, and you may then be required to log into that Service. After you complete this login process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that service so that we can, for example, post your content to that service when you ask us to. We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Service accounts.\\n\\nInformation Obtained from Third Party Services: In some cases, we partner with Third Party Services that may provide information about you. Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed that information to that third party and made it available for Tumblr to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use it to develop new Services or to improve or enhance the Services.\\n\\nWhen you connect other services to your Tumblr account, those services might share information about you with us. What gets shown to us is determined by their privacy policies, which are long and boring, but which you should probably read if you have questions or concerns.\\nUser Content: By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it. Although we do provide tools, like password-protected blogs, Asks, and Fan Mail, that let you publish content privately, you should assume that anything you publish is publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected otherwise. Also, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with another user, particularly through an Ask, Fan Mail, or submitted post, may be posted publicly by that user. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features native to the Services, such as reblogging.\\n\\nAt its heart, Tumblr is a public platform. Don’t be afraid to share amazing things, but do understand that it can be hard to completely remove things from the internet once they’ve been reblogged a few times.\\nNative Actions: The Services allow you to perform native actions that are integral to our products, such as liking a post, reblogging a post, replying to a post, and following a blog. Liking, reblogging, and replying are public actions – anyone can expand the “notes” view on a post, for example, to see who liked, reblogged, or replied to a post. We use information about native actions to improve the Services, develop new Services, and, particularly, to personalize your Tumblr experience. Personalization using this information may include presenting you with new posts relevant to what you’ve liked, providing you with better search results, and showing you advertising more relevant to your interests.\\n\\nReblogs, Likes, and Replies are a matter of public record, so if you’re truly ashamed of your desires it’s best to keep them to yourself. But why? Be proud of who you are. You’re beautiful. We’re looking you in the eyes and telling you how beautiful you are.\\nInformation About User Content: In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For example, when it\\'s included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings, or EXIF information. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality.\\n\\nFinancial Information: We will sometimes collect financial information, such as information related to your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). This happens when you decide to purchase a paid Service. We do not, however, store that financial information; such information is stored by our payment processor (the \"Payment Processor\"). Please note that if you use the Payment Processor\\'s services, your data will be handled in accordance with the Payment Processor\\'s privacy policy and practices. We don’t own or control the Payment Processor and they have their own rules about information collection, use, storage, and sharing, which you should review before using the Payment Processor\\'s services. We do receive certain information from our Payment Processor: (1) a unique token that we connect with your Account to enable you to make further purchases using the information stored by our Payment Processor and (2) in certain cases, the last four digits of the credit card number associated with that token, so that we can prevent fraudulent transactions and identity theft.\\n\\nInformation Related to Use of the Services: We collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an Account. This type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with (i.e., make a request to) the Services. We use internal tools and third party applications and services (like Google Analytics or comScore) to collect and analyze this information. Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”) used to access the Services; some may be connected with your Account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldn’t identify you or your Account). We also collect your IP Address when you make a post, particularly when you submit an anonymous “Ask.” We may use this information about how you and others interact with the Services for a number of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new Services, including but not limited to: providing users with personalized content; providing users with targeted advertising; improving our search results; identifying trending or popular content; fighting spam, malware, identity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for legal and safety reasons as set forth in “Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.”\\n\\nWe use information about how you interact with Tumblr in order to personalize it for you, to keep both you and our community safe from harm, and to improve Tumblr for everyone who uses it.\\nInformation Related to Your Web Browser: We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each request you make to the Services, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. We use web browser-related information to enhance and improve the Services.\\n\\nLocation Information: In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation. We may also ask you to provide information about your location, for example to use your geolocation information from your mobile device to geotag a post. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you, for example by showing you relevant local content.\\n\\nTumblr may determine your location by using drone technology and live video feeds. Ha ha, no, we just check out your IP address or any location data you attach to a post. Normal stuff.\\nInformation Related to Your Mobile Device: We may collect and store information related to your mobile device. In some cases, we may receive, generate, or assign your mobile device a unique identifier for the purposes described above in “Information Related to Use of the Services.” We may also ask you to provide your phone number to enable new products and improve the Services, such as by enabling multi-factor authentication for Account login. We will always ask you whether it’s OK for us to collect and store your phone number.\\n\\nInformation Collected Using Cookies and Other Technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites that allow Tumblr or a third party to see that you have looked at that page. We use cookies and web tags to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Some services that we use (including Third Party Services), such as Google Analytics, Nielsen, and comScore, may use their own web tags or place their own cookies on your browser. If you are a Tumblr user in the EU, UK, or in some US states you can customize your cookie preferences from your privacy settings.\\n\\nCookies and web tags let us learn how people use Tumblr, which in turn helps us make a better product for you to use. Tumblr gives you some choices over which cookies we set and how we use your data.\\nInformation About Your Contacts: Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists, so that we can connect you with people in our Services that are also on those contact lists. For example, you can temporarily connect your email contact information to your Account, so that we can provide you with a list of your email contacts that use the Services. As another example, you can send us your mobile phone contact information through our mobile applications, which then allows us to provide you with a list of those contacts that use the Services so that you can “follow” their blogs. We will give you a choice as to whether or not you provide us such information, and we will disclose fully, within the appropriate feature, how we use that information.\\n\\nWe won’t look at (or be able to look at) your contact list unless you ask us to. Why would you ask us to? Because that’s how you would find out if any of your contacts are on Tumblr. We discard this information immediately afterward.\\nDerived Information: As described above in “Native Actions” and “Information Related to Use of the Services,” we analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive of your Account (for example, what kinds of blogs you follow or what kinds of posts you view, like, or reblog). We use this information for all of the purposes set forth in “Information Related to Use of the Services,” above.\\n\\nPersonalized Advertising on Tumblr\\nIn order to provide you with all of this Tumblr content for free, Tumblr selectively runs advertisements. We, and our parent company, Automattic, work with online advertising companies to provide you with advertising that is as relevant and useful as possible. To make our ads more relevant and useful, we make educated guesses about your interests based on your activity on our sites and services. The ads we show you often reflect these interests and educated guesses.\\n\\nTo learn more about how we select the ads you see, you can check out Tumblr’s Advertising and affiliate policies.\\n\\nManaging your choices for personalized advertising experiences: In some geographic locations, Tumblr users have the legal right to opt-out of having ads personalized to them. Note that if you opt-out you will continue to see advertisements on Tumblr, though they will be less relevant and useful to you.\\n\\nIf you are a Tumblr user in the EU, UK, or in some US states you can customize your advertising preferences from within your privacy settings.\\n\\nWhen using the mobile app version of Tumblr on Apple iOS devices you can also opt out of personalized advertising by selecting \"Limit Ad Tracking\" in the iOS settings. For more information about these iOS options:\\n\\nOpen Settings;\\nSelect Privacy; and\\nSelect Advertising and follow the on-screen instructions.\\nWhen using the mobile app version of Tumblr on Android devices you can opt-out of personalized advertising by selecting \"Opt out of Interest Based Ads” in Google settings. For more information about these Android options:\\n\\nOpen Settings;\\nSelect Google;\\nSelect Privacy; and\\nSelect Ads and follow the on-screen instructions.\\nMore information about options for hiding, reporting, and controlling the ads you see on Tumblr can be found in our Tumblr Ads & You support doc.\\n\\nWith Whom Your Information Is Shared\\nWe never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this Privacy Policy); or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.\\n\\nInformation Shared with and Received from our Corporate Parents: We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Automattic, and a member of the Automattic family of companies. Because we are a wholly-owned subsidiary, Automattic and the rest of our family of companies may receive any information we do, and may share information they have with us. Our family of companies may use the information they receive from us to help us provide, understand, and improve the Services (including by providing us analytics) and in connection with their products and services (including by providing you with a more personalized experience). For details about how Automattic treats the information it collects, please review this Privacy Policy.\\n\\nAutomattic owns us and we share with it and the Automattic family of companies.\\nInformation Shared with the Public Through the Services: As noted in “User Content” and “Native Actions,” above, by default, content published through the Services and many actions you take on the Services are shared with the public. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by search engines, you should be careful about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it’s information you want to share with everyone.\\n\\nThe content you create on Tumblr is, by default, public. This means that anyone can see it, and that search engines can index it. If these things bother you, take a look at some of the additional privacy features we offer.\\nInformation Shared Between the Services: We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple Services and use that consolidated information to enhance and improve the Services, and to develop new Services.\\n\\nInformation You Share with Third Party Services: You may access Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on externally-pointing links. You may also choose to share information that you provide to us, like blog posts, with those Third Party Services (for example, by sharing posts to Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services\\' privacy policies.\\n\\nYou can automatically publish the posts you make on Tumblr to other sites (like Facebook or Twitter). That’s where our Privacy Policy ends and their policies begin. Make sure you’re cool with the policies of any services you’re considering sharing to before connecting them to your Tumblr account.\\nInformation Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services: In some cases, we share information we store (such as IP addresses) with third parties, such as service providers, consultants, and other agents (\"Agents\"), for the purposes of operating, enhancing, and improving the Services, and developing new products and services. For example, we may share information with service providers that help us fight spam, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you (hey there!), analytics providers that help us understand and improve our services, and third party partners that pitch in on our marketing efforts (like identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services), along with third-party consultants who may have access to information in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us.\\n\\nInformation Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.\\n\\nShould we happen to get acquired (again!) or go out of business (no way), the transfer of assets from us to our buyer may very well include user information. They are allowed to use it only in the ways outlined here, in the Privacy Policy you are reading right now.\\nInformation Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, trust and safety, or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of improving security and preventing fraud, spam, and malware), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm.\\n\\nDon’t make us narc on you. We don’t want to. But we do need to protect everyone who uses Tumblr from harming us, each other, or themselves. We work hard to balance privacy and community, and we’re sure you can appreciate the challenges in that, and the seriousness with which we take those challenges.\\nInformation We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request: If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.\\n\\nInformation Shared with Other Third Parties: We may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information, or other non-personally identifying information with people and entities that we do business with.\\n\\nSecurity and Retention of Your Information\\nYour Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We may enable additional security features in the future, like multi-factor authentication. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.\\n\\nWe seek to protect your information (including your Account Information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can\\'t guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.\\n\\nIt’s really important that you have a unique password for all of your accounts on the internet, including your Tumblr account. If you have trouble remembering passwords then you might consider using a service like 1Password or LastPass.\\nTumblr will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, for as long as your Tumblr account is active or as needed to provide you with the Services. If you no longer want Tumblr to use your information to provide you with the Services, you may close your account and Tumblr will delete the information it holds about you unless we need to retain and use your information to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements or as otherwise permitted by law.\\n\\nWhat Information You Can Access\\nIf you are a registered user, you can access most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.\\n\\nHow to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account\\nIf you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your Account Settings. Deleting your Account may not fully remove the content you have published from our systems, as caching of, backups of, copies of, or references to your Account Information may not be immediately removed. In addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, some of the public activity on your Account prior to deletion (such as reblogs of your blog posts) may remain stored on our servers and accessible to the public.\\n\\nYou’ll do great things on Tumblr, surely, but if it ever comes time to say goodbye, then you’re free to delete your account at any time and for any reason. The deletion will be effective immediately, for the most part, but it might take a little while to scrub everything from our archives and backups.\\n\\nWhat won’t get scrubbed are Reblogs of your posts. Those will remain on whatever blog reblogged them. Like we said before, it can be really, really hard to delete something once it goes out onto the internet, so be sure you’re only publishing stuff that you’re certain you want to publish.\\n\\nPrivacy Rights\\nIf you’re a resident of certain US states including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia, you have a number of rights and choices about your personal information. To learn more, see the Supplemental Privacy Notice below.\\n\\nChanges to This Privacy Policy\\nWe may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for modifications set forth in our Terms of Service. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.\\n\\nWhere to Direct Questions or Concerns\\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, send us a detailed message.\\n\\nLink to Prior Versions\\nYou will find a link to prior versions of our Privacy Policy below. We have stored these versions on GitHub, which will also allow you to compare different versions and see what terms have changed:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/tumblr/policy/commits/master/privacy-policy.txt\\n\\nSupplemental Privacy Notice\\nLaws in some US states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia, require us to provide residents with additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. This Notice covers that required additional information as a supplement to the information in our privacy policy above.\\n\\nSummary of Information We Collect\\nIn the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information (as those terms are defined by applicable law)\\n\\nIdentifiers (such as username and email address);\\nCommercial information (such as transaction data);\\nFinancial data (such as credit card and other financial account information);\\nInternet or other network or device activity (such as unique identifiers, browsing history or other usage data);\\nGeolocation information (general location);\\nInference data about you;\\nLegally protected classifications (such as gender);\\nPhysical characteristics or description (such as when you voluntarily submit a photo);\\nOr other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.\\nYou can find more information about what we collect, the business and commercial purposes we use it for, and the sources of that information in the “What We Collect and How We Use It” section above.\\n\\nWe share this information with the categories of third parties described above in “With Whom Your Information Is Shared.\"We retain this information for the length of time described in our Security and Retention of Your Information section.\\n\\nWe may also use the categories of personal information for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We may aggregate the information we collect or de-identify it in order to limit or prevent the identification of any particular user or device.\\n\\nIn some US states, you have additional rights subject to any exemptions provided by your state’s respective law. You can find detailed metrics about Tumblr\\'s compliance with these rights in our Privacy Report here.\\n\\nAccess: Some US states give you the right to request a copy of certain information we hold about you, as well as a summary of: the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months, the categories of sources of such information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or sharing that information, and the categories of third parties with whom we shared that information. As described in the section ‘What Information You Can Access,’ you can access much of your information by logging in to your Tumblr account. You can also request a personal data report by submitting a request in the Privacy section of your Settings. You need to be signed in to your Tumblr account to submit this request, and you will have to log in to your account to access the summary or the report. If you want to request the summary described above, require additional assistance, or if you do not have a Tumblr account, submit a support ticket here or email us at ccpa@tumblr.com.\\nDelete: In some US states you also have the right to delete certain information we have about you. You can delete much of your information by logging in to your account. If you cannot do this, or you do not have a Tumblr account, please submit a support ticket here, or email us at ccpa@tumblr.com. For more information on deleting your account or leaving Tumblr, please refer to the section ‘How to Delete Your Account.’\\nNon-Discrimination: You also have the right not to be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.\\nCorrect: In general you can correct any information Tumblr has about you by editing your account. For example, you can update your email address from your account settings. If there’s any information we have about you that you would like corrected, that you can’t change yourself, you can contact our support team to request this.\\nOpt-Out: You may have the right to opt-out of having your data sold or shared (as those terms are defined in your state’s law). More on how to do that below.\\nPortability: At Tumblr it’s totally possible to export your blog. It’s your stuff, not ours. We make it easy for you to grab a copy of it\\nCertain information may be exempt from these rights under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide you with the Services. If you ask us to delete them, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.\\n\\nBefore we can satisfy your request, you’ll need to give us enough information so that we can be certain of your identity. To do that, you’ll need to log in to your account or give us certain information about you and/or your use of the Services. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you have to give us written authorization for the agent to act on your behalf. You’ll still need to verify your identity directly with us.\\n\\nRight to Opt-Out: Tumblr selectively runs advertisements so we can provide you with Tumblr content for free. To help select which ads to show you, we may share some of your information with advertising partners, or allow our advertising partners to “collect” certain information. The personal information we share includes online identifiers and internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address), and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address). In some US states, this data sharing may be considered a “sale.” To learn more about how we select the ads you see, check out Tumblr’s Ads & You. We do not sell (or share) information that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information, in our ads program. Also, we do not knowingly \"sell\" your personal information if you are under 16.\\n\\nLearn how you can opt out by going to Your Advertising Choices. If you are a user who has told us you are under 16, you’ll see in your settings that we’ve already opted you out.\\n\\nIn addition to the data sharing related to our ads program, sometimes Tumblr shares your information with our third-party service providers to provide our services to you. To the extent that we share your information with certain advertising, marketing, or analytics vendors, this can be considered a \"sale\" or “share” in certain U.S. States, which you may have the right to opt out of. This opt-out is controlled through the same opt-out as the personalized ads program opt-out, found in your settings. We also respect the GPC browser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire to opt out.\\n\\nWe do not collect or process your sensitive (and potentially sensitive) personal information except where it is strictly necessary to provide you with our service, where the processing is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or for other purposes that do not require an option to limit under California law.\\n\\nAppeals Process for Denied Requests\\nIn some circumstances we may deny your request to exercise one of these rights. For example, if we cannot verify that you are the account owner we may deny your request to access the personal information associated with your account. As another example, if we are legally required to maintain a copy of your personal information we may deny your request to delete your personal information.\\n\\nIn the event that we deny your request, we will communicate this fact to you in writing. You may appeal our decision by responding in writing to our denial email and stating that you would like to appeal.\\n\\nIf your appeal is denied, in some US states (Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia) you may refer the denied appeal to the state attorney general if you believe the denial is in conflict with your legal rights. The process for how to do this will be communicated to you in writing at the same time we send you our decision about your appeal.\\n\\nContacting Us About These Rights\\nYou can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll up to “Where to Direct Questions or Concerns” to, well, find out where to direct your questions or concerns.', 0)\n",

Most people who use Twitter want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a Tweet, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.\\n\\nWith that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use Twitter by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared. \\n\\nSo if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:\\n\\n \\n\\nTwitter is a public platform\\n\\nLearn what’s viewable & searchable\\n\\nWe collect some data\\nabout you\\n\\nLearn what we collect & how\\n\\nAffiliate services may have their own policies\\n\\nLearn about affiliates\\n\\nWe use your data to make Twitter better\\n\\nLearn how we make your info work\\n\\nYou can control your experience\\n\\nLearn how to update your settings\\n\\nIf you have questions about how we use data, just ask\\n\\nLearn how to contact us\\n\\ntrue\\nSeriously — what happens with my data?\\nWhat data do you collect about me?\\nYou give some data, we get some data.

How We Use Information\\n\\nBreaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us. Here we go:\\n\\nExpand dropdowns for more information:\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 Foster safety and security.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.4 Communicate with you about our services.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.5 Research.\\n\\n\\ntrue\\nMy Tweets are public?!?\\nHow or when do you share my information?\\nThere’s no quick answer to this one, but heads up: Tweets can end up in the news or a search engine.\\n\\n3.

How Long We Keep Information\\n\\nWe keep different types of information for different periods of time: \\n\\nWe keep your profile information and content for the duration of your account.\\n\\nWe generally keep other personally identifiable data we collect when you use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.\\n\\nRemember public content can exist elsewhere even after you remove it from Twitter. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your Tweets longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on Twitter. You can read more about search visibility here.\\n\\nWhere you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (i.e., email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.\\n\\nWe may keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.\\n\\nHow can I control my data?\\nYou can access it, delete it, or change your settings.

Our services include:\\n\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.\\n\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\n\\n\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\n\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\n\\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\n\\nThings you create or provide to us\\n\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\n\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\n\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\n\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\n\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\n\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\\n\\nYour activity\\n\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\n\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\n\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\\n\\n\\nGo to Google Account\\n\\nYour location information\\n\\nWe collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location.\\n\\nYour location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:\\n\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\n\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\n\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\n\\n\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\n\\nProvide our services\\n\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\n\\nMaintain & improve our services\\n\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\n\\nDevelop new services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\n\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\n\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\n\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\n\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\n\\nGo to My Ad Center\\n\\nMeasure performance\\n\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\n\\nCommunicate with you\\n\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\n\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\n\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\n\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\n\\nWe may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\n\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\n\\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\n\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\n\\n\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\n\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\n\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\n\\nPrivacy controls\\n\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations.

We may collect, or process on behalf of our customers, the following categories of personal data when you use or interact with Zoom products and services:\\n\\nAccount Information: Information associated with an account that licenses Zoom products and services, which may include administrator name, contact information, account ID, billing and transaction information, and account plan information.\\nProfile and Participant Information: Information associated with the Zoom profile of a user who uses Zoom products and services under a licensed account or that is provided by an unlicensed participant joining a meeting, which may include name, display name, picture, email address, phone number, job information, stated locale, user ID, or other information provided by the user and/or their account owner.\\nContact Information: Contact information added by accounts and/or their users to create contact lists on Zoom products and services, which may include contact information a user integrates from a third-party app, or provided by users to process referral invitations.\\nSettings: Information associated with the preferences and settings on a Zoom account or user profile, which may include audio and video settings, recording file location, screen sharing settings, and other settings and configuration information.\\nRegistration Information: Information provided when registering for a Zoom meeting, webinar, Zoom Room, or recording, which may include name and contact information, responses to registration questions, and other registration information requested by the host.\\nDevice Information: Information about the computers, phones, and other devices used when interacting with Zoom products and services, which may include information about the speakers, microphone, camera, OS version, hard disk ID, PC name, MAC address, IP address (which may be used to infer general location at a city or country level), device attributes (like operating system version and battery level), WiFi information, and other device information (like Bluetooth signals).\\nContent and Context from Meetings, Webinars, Messaging, and Other Collaborative Features: Content generated in meetings, webinars, or messages that are hosted on Zoom products and services, which may include audio, video, in-meeting messages, in-meeting and out-of-meeting whiteboards, chat messaging content, transcriptions, transcript edits and recommendations, written feedback, responses to polls and Q&A, and files, as well as related context, such as invitation details, meeting or chat name, or meeting agenda. Content may contain your voice and image, depending on the account owner’s settings, what you choose to share, your settings, and what you do on Zoom products and services.\\nUsage Information Regarding Meetings, Webinars, Messaging, Collaborative Features and the Website: Information about how people and their devices interact with Zoom products and services, such as: when participants join and leave a meeting; whether participants sent messages and who they message with; performance data; mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes or actions (such as mute/unmute or video on/off), edits to transcript text, where authorized by the account owner and other inputs that help Zoom to understand feature usage, improve product design, and suggest features; which third-party apps are added to a meeting or other product or service and what information and actions the app is authorized to access and perform; use of third-party apps and the Zoom App Marketplace; features used (such as screen sharing, emojis, or filters); and other usage information and metrics. This also includes information about when and how people visit and interact with Zoom’s websites, including what pages are accessed, interaction with website features, and whether or not the person signed up for a Zoom product or service.\\nLimited Information from Zoom Email and Calendar Services: “Zoom Email” refers to Zoom’s native email service and emails sent from Zoom’s native email service. Zoom Email is designed to be end-to-end encrypted by Zoom by default for emails sent and received directly between active Zoom Email users. Support for end-to-end encryption requires Zoom Email users to have added a device to their Zoom Email account with the associated email address and to use a supported Zoom client. When an email is end-to-end encrypted, only the users, and, depending on their settings, account owners, or designated account administrators control the encryption key and therefore access to the email content, including body text, subject line, attachments and custom labels applied to messages by users in their inboxes. Emails sent to or received from non-Zoom Email users are encrypted after the email is sent or received from Zoom’s servers, if the Zoom Email user chooses to send them with encryption. In all cases, Zoom does have access to email metadata used for basic email delivery—specifically, email addresses in the from, to, cc, and bcc fields, time, mimeID, and the number and size of attachments. From use of Zoom’s native calendar service, Zoom receives information regarding meeting invitations, body text, sender and recipients, and other calendar information.\\nContent from Third-Party Integrations: Users can access email and calendars from third-party services through their Zoom client, if they choose to integrate them.  This information is not end-to-end encrypted by Zoom, but Zoom employees do not access this content, unless directed to, or required for legal, safety, or security reasons.  If account owners and/or their users integrate their third-party emails with products and services offered or powered by Zoom, such as business analytics tools like ZoomIQ, Zoom may collect or process email information, including email content, headers and metadata, from such third-party services in order to provide services requested by the account and to improve the product.\\nCommunications with Zoom: Information about your communications with Zoom, including relating to support questions, your account, and other inquiries.\\nInformation from Partners: Zoom obtains information about account owners and their users from third-party companies, such as market data enrichment services, including information about an account owner’s company size or industry, contact information, or activity of certain enterprise domains. Zoom may also obtain information from third-party advertising partners who deliver ads displayed on Zoom products and services, such as whether you clicked on an ad they showed you.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, some of the personal data Zoom receives may be considered sensitive. Please see “California & Other Other U.S. State Privacy Rights” for more information.\\n\\nHow Do We Use Personal Data?\\nZoom employees do not access meeting, webinar, messaging or email content (specifically, audio, video, files, in-meeting whiteboards, messaging or email contents), or any content generated or shared as part of other collaborative features (such as out-of-meeting whiteboards), unless authorized by an account owner, or as required for legal, safety, or security reasons, as discussed below, and where technically feasible.

This may also include using personal data for customer support, which may include accessing audio, video, files, messages, and other content or context, at the direction of the account owner or their users. We also use personal data to manage our relationship and contracts with account owners and others, including billing, compliance with contractual obligations, facilitating payment to third-party developers in relation to purchases made through the Zoom App Marketplace, and related administration.\\nAdvanced Voice and Video Features: If available, and if you elect to use certain video features, such as filters, studio effects, avatars, and gestures, information about your movements or the positioning of your face or hands may be processed on your device to apply the selected features. Such data does not leave your device, is not retained, is not used to identify you, and is only used to generate the selected effects. If certain features are enabled, such as transcription generation for recordings, Zoom may use technology that analyzes the meeting’s audio recording to distinguish one speaker from another in order to create an accurate transcript. The audio analysis is not retained after the transcript is generated.\\nProduct Research and Development: To develop, test, and improve Zoom products and services, including, for example, content-related features (such as background and other filters), and to troubleshoot products and services.\\nMarketing, Promotions, and Third-Party Advertising: To permit Zoom and/or its third party marketing partners to market, advertise, and promote Zoom products and services, including based on your product usage, information we receive from third-party partners, information you provide to process referral invitations, or if you visit our websites, information about how and when you visit, and your interactions with them.

These vendors can access personal data subject to contractual and technical requirements for protecting personal data and prohibiting them from using personal data for any purpose other than to provide services to Zoom or as required by law. Zoom may integrate third-party technology to provide advanced features, such as Apple’s TrueDepth technology, to process information on your device about face or hand dimensions and gestures to provide video effects.

Where required by law, Zoom will first obtain your consent before engaging in the marketing or advertising activities described.\\nCorporate Affiliates: Zoom shares personal information with corporate affiliates, such as Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., to provide integrated and consistent experiences across Zoom products and services (such as enabling an account owner or their user to integrate a Zoom Phone call into a meeting) and to detect, investigate, and prevent fraud, abuse, and threats to public safety.\\nChange of Control: We may share personal data with actual or prospective acquirers, their representatives and other relevant participants in, or during negotiations of, any sale, merger, acquisition, restructuring, or change in control involving all or a portion of Zoom’s business or assets, including in connection with bankruptcy or similar proceedings.\\nThird-Party Developers: If you purchase a third-party app or integration from the Zoom App Marketplace, Zoom may share information about the purchase with the third-party developer, to provide the app or integration.\\nWho Can See, Share, and Process My Personal Data When I Join Meetings and Use Other Zoom Products and Services?\\nWhen you send messages or join meetings and webinars on Zoom, other people and organizations, including third parties outside the meeting, webinar, or message, may be able to see content and information that you share:\\n\\nAccount Owner: An account owner is the organization or individual that signs up for a Zoom account.

Depending on their settings, account owners also can see sender and receiver information, and other messaging data, along with the content of messages sent to and from users on their account (including from in-meeting chat where dedicated meeting group chats are enabled), unless the account owner has enabled Advanced Chat Encryption. Depending on their settings, account owners and those they authorize may also see the content shared through collaborative features, including whiteboards, files, and images shared in Zoom Team Chat.\\nIn-Meeting/Webinar Messages:  Depending on their settings, account owners can see sender and receiver information, along with the content of messages sent to and from users on their account, in the following circumstances:\\nMessages sent to Everyone in a meeting that is recorded\\nMessages sent to the meeting group chat in a meeting when a dedicated meeting group chat is enabled\\nMessages sent to panelists in a webinar that is recorded\\nMessages sent in dedicated meeting group chats in Team Chat\\nDirect messages if the account owner has enabled archiving\\nIf a participant in a meeting is subject to archiving, their account owner will have access to messages sent to Everyone in the meeting, as well as direct messages sent to that participant.

            "(11, 'Communication', 'Microsoft Teams', 'Privacy and Microsoft Teams\\nArticle\\n02/15/2023\\n4 minutes to read\\n6 contributors\\nApplies to:\\nMicrosoft Teams\\nWhen an organization is considering relying on Microsoft Teams for communication and collaboration, privacy is something that needs to be addressed at every level. The questions we have below should address the privacy concerns you may have when planning your Teams implementation, or at any point during Teams usage.\\n\\nWhat personal data does Microsoft Teams collect and for what purposes does Microsoft Teams use this data?\\nMicrosoft processes the personal data in Microsoft Teams to deliver the agreed-upon services defined in the Online Services Terms and ultimately for the purposes determined by the data controller obtaining the service. Microsoft Teams, as a cloud-based service, processes various types of personal data as part of delivering the service. This personal data includes:\\n\\nContent Your meetings and conversations chats, voicemail, shared files, recordings and transcriptions.\\nProfile Data Data that is shared within your company about you. Examples include your E-mail address, profile picture, and phone number.\\nCall History A detailed history of the phone calls you make, which allows you to go back and review your own call records.\\nCall Quality data Details of meetings and call data are available to your system administrators. This allows your administrators to diagnose issues related to poor call quality and service usage.\\nSupport/Feedback data Information related to troubleshooting tickets or feedback submission to Microsoft.\\nDiagnostic and service data Diagnostic data related to service usage. This personal data allows Microsoft to deliver the service (troubleshoot, secure and update the product and monitor performance) as well as perform some internal business operations, such as:\\nDetermine revenue\\nDevelop metrics\\nDetermine service usage\\nConduct product and capacity planning\\nTo the extent Microsoft Teams processes personal data in connection with Microsoft\\'s legitimate business operations, Microsoft will be an independent data controller for such use and will be responsible for complying with all applicable laws and controller obligations.\\n\\nLegal Basis of Processing\\nOur customers are controllers for the data provided to Microsoft, as set forth in the Online Services Terms, and they determine legal bases of processing. Microsoft, in turn, processes the data on the customers\\' instructions, as a processor.\\n\\nTo the extent Microsoft processes personal data in connection with its own legitimate business operations, as described in the Online Services Terms, Microsoft will be an independent controller for such processing, the legal basis of which is legitimate interests. \"Microsoft\\'s legitimate business operations\" consist of the following, each as incident to delivery of Microsoft Teams to the customer: (1) billing and account management; (2) compensation (e.g., calculating employee commissions and partner incentives); (3) internal reporting and modeling (e.g., forecasting, revenue, capacity planning, product strategy); (4) combatting fraud, cybercrime, or cyber-attacks that may affect Microsoft or Microsoft Products; (5) improving the core functionality of accessibility, privacy or energy-efficiency; and (6) financial reporting and compliance with legal obligations.\\n\\nWhat third parties have access to personal data?\\nMicrosoft will not disclose personal data except:\\n\\nas the customer directs (including as required to complete phone calls);\\nas described in the Online Service Terms (such as the use of authorized subcontractors to provide certain components of services);\\nas required by law.\\nIf law enforcement contacts Microsoft with a demand, Microsoft will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that personal data directly from the customer. If compelled to disclose personal data to law enforcement, Microsoft will promptly notify the customer and provide a copy of the demand unless legally prohibited from doing so. For more information about data that we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our Law Enforcement Requests Report.\\n\\nThe Teams Security Guide has more information about our compliance standards.\\n\\nWhere does Teams transfer and store personal data?\\nPersonal data is transferred and stored as set forth in the Online Service Terms.\\n\\nFor transfers of personal data from the EEA, EU, Switzerland, and the UK, Microsoft is certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and the commitments they entail, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of Personal Data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.\\n\\nWe have information on the Location of data in Microsoft Teams if you need to learn more.\\n\\nHow long does Microsoft Teams retain personal data?\\nMicrosoft Teams retains your data for the minimum amount of time necessary to deliver the service.\\n\\nBecause this data is required to provide the service, this typically means that we retain personal data until the user stops using Microsoft Teams, or until the user deletes personal data. If a user (or an administrator on the user\\'s behalf) deletes the data, Microsoft will ensure that all copies of the personal data are deleted within 30 days.\\n\\nIf a company terminates service with Microsoft, corresponding personal data will all be deleted between 90 and 180 days of service termination.\\n\\nIn some circumstances, local laws require that Microsoft Teams retain telephone records (for billing purposes) for a specific period of time, in those circumstances Microsoft Teams follows the law for each region.\\n\\nAdditionally, if a company requests that Microsoft Teams hold a user\\'s data to support a legal obligation, Microsoft will respect the company administrator\\'s request.\\n\\nRight to withdraw consent\\nIf Microsoft Teams processes any personal data based on consent, you may have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You should direct your request to withdraw consent to your administrator, where your administrator is the controller of the personal data at issue.\\n\\nContact Details of Microsoft\\'s Data Protection Officer\\nIf you have a privacy concern, complaint or question for the Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer and EU Data Protection Officer, please contact us by using our web form. Our EU Data Protection Officer is located at Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland. Telephone: +353 1 706 3117.

If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the “data controller” of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our Terms of Service). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It’s important that you read this entire policy, but here’s a summary to get you started:\\n\\nWe care a lot about privacy. We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find belonging. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission.\\nWe don’t sell your data. Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products.\\nWe limit what information is required. We require the information that enables us to create your account, provide our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our legal requirements. The rest is optional.\\nWe care deeply about safety. Our dedicated Trust & Safety team works hard to help keep our community safe. We also use certain information to help us identify violations of our Community Guidelines and prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services.\\nWe give you control. We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord.\\nDiscord is your place to talk\\nWe built Discord to be your place to talk. Whether you’re part of a club, gaming group, worldwide art community, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to talk every day and hang out more often.\\n\\nOur “services” has the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Service. They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance—any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information through other means like surveys, emails, and social media.\\n\\nAs explained in our Terms of Service, we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger communities. Some of these spaces are public, and if you share content within them, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time.\\n\\nWe may also use content posted in public spaces to help power features like Server Discovery and to help us identify harmful content on the services. These features are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know what spaces are public within Discord (though we don’t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). And you can control whether your content is used for these purposes as described in the “How to control your privacy” section below. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the space, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content.\\n\\nWe make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties.\\n\\nThe information we collect\\nWe collect certain information when you use Discord. This includes information you provide to us, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources.\\n\\nInformation you provide to us\\nAccount information. When you create a Discord account, you can come up with a username and password, and provide a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). You’ll also need to provide your birthday. To access certain features or communities, you may need to verify your account or add other information (like a verified phone number) to your account. You may also have the option to add your name or nicknames.\\nContent you create. This includes any content that you upload to the service. For example, you may write messages (including drafts), create custom emojis, or upload and share files through the services. This also includes your profile information and the information you provide when you create servers. We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels. If we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance. We also don’t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time.\\nPurchase information. If you buy any paid services through Discord, you may need to submit a valid payment method and associated billing information, including your full name and billing address. Our payment processors, like Stripe and PayPal, receive and process your payment information. Depending on the processor, we may also receive and store certain billing information, including the last four digits of the credit card number associated with the transaction. If we decide to process our own payments in the future, we would receive and process this information ourselves.\\nInformation from actions you take. We collect information about your use of and activities on the services. This includes the friends you add, the servers or other communities you join, your roles in servers, content moderation decisions you make, and other related actions.\\nInformation used to enable optional features. Certain features, like contact syncing, may require that you provide additional information (or grant us access to such information) to make them work. This also includes information about third party integrations you choose to enable and the data you authorize those third party services to share with us. For example, when you link a music streaming account, we may collect information about that account such as the song you are listening to in order to display that information on your profile or as your status (if you have chosen to do so).\\nOther information you provide directly to us. You may have the option to submit additional information as you use Discord. For example, you may choose to participate in our verified server program, which requires that you provide additional information about yourself or your company. Or, you may participate in surveys where you can provide feedback on the product, or submit information to our Discord Support teams.\\nInformation we collect automatically\\nWe also collect information automatically from you when you use Discord. This includes:\\n\\nInformation about your device. We collect information about the device you are using to access the services. This includes information like your IP address, operating system information, browser information, and information about your device settings, such as your microphone and/or camera.\\nInformation about your use of the apps or websites. We collect log and event information related to how and when you use our services (such as the pages, servers, and channels you visit).\\nOther information that we collect automatically. When you take certain actions on other sites, we may receive information about you. For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from.\\nWe may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services. You can control cookies as described in the “How to control your privacy” section below. The services use the following types of cookies:\\n\\nStrictly Necessary Cookies: These are required for services to function. If you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly.\\nFunctional Cookies: These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences. Disabling these could affect some service functionality.\\nPerformance Cookies: These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them.\\nInformation we receive from other sources\\nWe may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform.\\n\\nHow we use your information\\nWe use your information for the following purposes:\\n\\n\\u200dTo fulfill our contract with you\\n\\nTo provide you with the services. We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work. We similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct. We also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases. When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app).\\nTo meet our commitments to the Discord community. We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies. This includes responding to user reports, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us and public posts, to develop and improve systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct.\\nTo personalize the product. We use your information to provide, personalize and improve our services. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the “How to control your privacy” section below, you can choose whether to allow us to personalize your Discord experience.\\nTo contact you. We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes, to send you information about products you have purchased, or just to let you know about new products or features we think you’ll like. You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications.\\nTo provide customer service. We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues.\\nFor our legitimate business interests\\n\\nTo protect our services. We use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them.\\nTo report on our company’s performance. We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues.\\nTo improve our services. We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use public posts to better understand, for example, what topics public servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers. As discussed in the ”How to control your privacy” section below, you can control whether your data is used for these purposes.\\nTo advertise our services on other platforms. We are proud of the product we\\'ve built and spend money advertising it on other platforms in order to bring more users to Discord. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future.\\nTo comply with our legal obligations\\n\\nWe retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request identification and verification documents from you for the purpose of confirming your identity.\\n\\n\\u200dWith your consent\\n\\n\\u200dWe may also collect and use personal information with your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information.\\n\\n\\u200dTo protect someone’s vital interests\\n\\nWe may collect or share personal data if we think someone’s life is in danger—for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation.\\n\\nHow we share your information\\nWhen you tell us to. When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to share that content with certain communities, people, or in the case of public spaces, with anyone who accesses it. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular community. Server owners or admins set those permissions, and they control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service) or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, you may be telling us to share certain information with that service, or with other Discord users. You can control this sharing as described in the \"How to control your privacy\" section below. We may also share your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so.\\nWith our vendors. We may share information with vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also share limited information with advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our product and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord.\\nTo comply with the law. We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities.\\nIn an emergency. We may share information if we believe in good faith that it\\'s necessary to prevent serious harm to a person.\\nTo enforce our policies and rights. We may share information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.\\nWith our related companies. We may share information with our related companies, including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.\\nSale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets. We may share information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets.\\nAggregated or de-identified information. We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public.\\nData retention\\nWe retain personal information for as long as it is needed for the purposes for which we collected it. If your account is inactive for more than two years, we may delete it, and we may delete or anonymize any personal information associated with your account.\\n\\nIf you submit an ID for an age verification appeal, we will delete it within sixty days after the age appeal ticket is closed.\\n\\nHow we protect your information\\nWe take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication.\\n\\nHow to control your privacy\\nWe believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here’s how you can control how we process your information and how to request access to your information:\\n\\n\\u200dBe aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in\\n\\nYou can always choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services. You can choose what messages to send or post, who to engage with (e.g., one or more particular users or a potentially unlimited group of users), what information to include in your profile, whether to connect any third party services to your Discord account, and more. For example, if you share content in public spaces, it may be accessed by anyone. Public content may also be subject to fewer restrictions under your local laws.\\n\\n\\u200dCustomize your personal Discord settings\\n\\nWe offer a number of settings that allow you to tailor your experience within Discord. Some of these relate to specific features: for example, you can choose whether to display your current activity in your status via the Activity Status tab in your User Settings page (this is the gear icon next to your name).\\n\\nYou can also access privacy-specific settings in the Privacy & Safety section of your User Settings. For example, you can decide which types of direct messages are scanned for explicit content, who can add you as a friend, and more. This is also where you can restrict certain types of processing of your information:\\n\\nRestrict our ability to use your data to improve our products. If you turn off the “Use data to improve Discord” setting, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information to help us understand how users use our services, what features or products they may want, or to otherwise improve our services.\\nRestrict our ability to personalize Discord for you. If the “Use data to customize my Discord experience” setting is disabled, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information to help us offer you relevant recommendations for in-app content and features.\\nYou can also disable or delete your account via the “My Account” tab on the settings page. Disabling your account stops the processing of new data, but allows you to reactivate your account without interruption to you. Deleting your account permanently deletes identifying information and anonymizes other data.\\n\\nManage your content and servers\\n\\nYou may edit or erase specific pieces of information within the services:\\n\\nYou can edit or delete any message you have sent or content you have posted if you still have access to the space where you posted it.\\nYou can edit or delete a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so.\\nYou can edit or delete a channel from a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so.\\nPublic posts may be retained by Discord for use as described elsewhere in this policy. Also, in limited circumstances, we may have a legal obligation to retain certain information, even if you delete the information or your account.\\n\\nIf you want to see what information we have collected about you, you can request a copy of your data by selecting Request Data in the Privacy & Safety section of your User Settings. You should receive your data packet within 30 days. Data is delivered in common digital formats including CSV, JSON, and any other file format you used when uploading attachments to the services.\\n\\nManage cookies\\nTo control how information is collected and used from cookies on the services, you can take one or more of the following steps.\\n\\nYou can disable and manage some cookies through your browser settings. You will need to manage your settings for each browser you use. You can find instructions for how to manage Cookies in popular browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari (iOS), Safari (Mac), and Opera.\\nTo disable analytics cookies, you can use the browser controls discussed above or, for certain providers, you can use their individual opt-out mechanisms, such as Google Analytics Opt-Out.\\nYour mobile device may also include browser settings to manage the use of cookies. Your device may also have settings to control the collection and use information in your apps.\\nThird party groups also enable you to limit how cookies are used for advertising purposes by participating third parties. You can learn more at Network Advertising Initiative, the Digital Advertising Alliance, and for users in the EU, the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.\\nDepending on where you are accessing our services, you may be able to adjust your cookie preferences at any time through a cookies banner or by selecting “Cookie Settings” from the footer or menu on our website.\\nIf you disable or remove cookies, some parts of the services may not function properly. Information may be collected to remember your opt-out preferences.\\n\\nQuestions or concerns about your privacy? You can email us at privacy@discord.com.\\n\\nInternational data transfers\\nWe are based in the United States, and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.\\n\\nWhen transferring data outside the EEA, we use standard contract clauses, and we rely on the European Commission\\'s adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer.\\n\\nWe also adhere to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Program and comply with its framework and principles. Although the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Program is no longer a valid basis for certain international data transfers, we continue to comply with the Privacy Shield framework and principles with respect to personal data received from the EU in addition to all other applicable laws.\\n\\nIf you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries.\\n\\nFor more information about the Privacy Shield principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield site.\\n\\nServices offered by third parties\\nWe allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add “bots” created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services.\\n\\nThese third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don’t control them or what information they collect. It’s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general.\\n\\nData Protection Officer\\nYou can contact Discord’s Data Protection Officer at dpo@discord.com.\\n\\nInformation for EEA, United Kingdom, and Brazil Users\\nCertain local laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), require services to provide information about the information they collect, how they use it, and the lawful basis for processing it. We’ve described most of that already in the earlier portions of this Policy.\\n\\n\\u200dExercising your rights: You can exercise your GDPR rights as described in the “How to control your privacy” section above.

This privacy statement explains the personal data Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes.\\n\\nMicrosoft offers a wide range of products, including server products used to help operate enterprises worldwide, devices you use in your home, software that students use at school, and services developers use to create and host what’s next. References to Microsoft products in this statement include Microsoft services, websites, apps, software, servers, and devices.\\n\\nPlease read the product-specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional relevant information. This statement applies to the interactions Microsoft has with you and the Microsoft products listed below, as well as other Microsoft products that display this statement.\\n\\nYoung people may prefer starting with the Privacy for young people page. That page highlights information that may be helpful for young people.\\n\\nPersonal data we collect\\nMicrosoft collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.\\n\\nIf you represent an organisation, such as a business or school, that utilises Enterprise and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. If you are an end user of a Microsoft product or a Microsoft account provided by your organisation, please see the Products provided by your organisation and the Microsoft account sections for more information.\\n\\nYou have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalisation that use such data will not work for you.\\n\\nLearn more\\nTop of page\\nHow we use personal data\\nMicrosoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:\\n\\nProvide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.\\nImprove and develop our products.\\nPersonalise our products and make recommendations.\\nAdvertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.\\nWe also use the data to operate our business, which includes analysing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce and doing research.\\n\\nIn carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalised experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.\\n\\nOur processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies. This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.\\n\\nLearn more\\nTop of page\\nReasons we share personal data\\nWe share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorised. We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers.\\n\\nPlease note that, as defined under certain U.S. state data privacy laws, “sharing” also relates to providing personal data to third parties for personalised advertising purposes. Please see the U.S. State Data Privacy section below and our U.S. State Data Privacy Laws Notice for more information.\\n\\nLearn more\\nTop of page\\nHow to access and control your personal data\\nYou can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by Microsoft. You can control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting Microsoft or using various tools we provide. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law. How you can access or control your personal data will also depend on which products you use. For example, you can:\\n\\nControl the use of your data for personalised advertising from Microsoft by visiting our opt-out page.\\nChoose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls and postal mail from Microsoft.\\nAccess and clear some of your data through the Microsoft privacy dashboard.\\nNot all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the How to contact us section or by using our web form.\\n\\nWe provide aggregate metrics about user requests to exercise their data protection rights via the Microsoft Privacy Report.\\n\\nLearn more\\nTop of page\\nCookies and similar technologies\\nCookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for storing and honouring your preferences and settings, enabling you to sign-in, providing interest-based advertising, combating fraud, analysing how our products perform and fulfilling other legitimate purposes. Microsoft apps use additional identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows described in the Advertising ID section of this privacy statement, for similar purposes.\\n\\nWe also use “web beacons” to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons, cookies, or similar technologies from third-party service providers.\\n\\nYou have a variety of tools to control the data collected by cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. For example, you can use controls in your internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies and to withdraw your consent by clearing or blocking cookies.\\n\\nLearn more\\nTop of page\\nProducts provided by your organisation – notice to end users\\nIf you use a Microsoft product with an account provided by an organisation you are affiliated with, such as your work or school account, that organisation can:\\n\\nControl and administer your Microsoft product and product account, including controlling privacy-related settings of the product or product account.\\nAccess and process your data, including the interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files associated with your Microsoft product and product accounts.\\nIf you lose access to your work or school account (in event of change of employment, for example), you may lose access to products and the content associated with those products, including those you acquired on your own behalf, if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.\\n\\nMany Microsoft products are intended for use by organisations, such as schools and businesses. Please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement. If your organisation provides you with access to Microsoft products, your use of the Microsoft products is subject to your organisation’s policies, if any. You should direct your privacy enquiries, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to your organisation’s administrator.

Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this privacy statement.\\n\\nWhen you use a Microsoft product provided by your organisation, Microsoft’s processing of your personal data in connection with that product is governed by a contract between Microsoft and your organisation. Microsoft processes your personal data to provide the product to your organisation and you, and in some cases for Microsoft’s business operations related to providing the product as described in the Enterprise and developer products section. As mentioned above, if you have questions about Microsoft’s processing of your personal data in connection with providing products to your organisation, please contact your organisation. If you have questions about Microsoft’s business operations in connection with providing products to your organisation as provided in the Product Terms, please contact Microsoft as described in the How to contact us section. For more information on our business operations, please see the Enterprise and developer products section.\\n\\nFor Microsoft products provided by your K-12 school, including Microsoft 365 Education, Microsoft will:\\n\\nnot collect or use student personal data beyond that needed for authorised educational or school purposes;\\nnot sell or rent student personal data;\\nnot use or share student personal data for advertising or similar commercial purposes, such as behavioural targeting of advertisements to students;\\nnot build a personal profile of a student, other than for supporting authorised educational or school purposes or as authorised by the parent, guardian or student of appropriate age; and\\nrequire that our vendors with whom student personal data is shared to deliver the educational service, if any, are obligated to implement these same commitments for student personal data.\\nTop of page\\nMicrosoft account\\nWith a Microsoft account, you can sign in to Microsoft products, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favourites. Signing in to your Microsoft account enables personalisation and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account and enables other features.\\n\\nThere are three types of Microsoft account:\\n\\nWhen you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a personal Microsoft account.\\nWhen you or your organisation (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organisation, we refer to that account as a work or school account.\\nWhen you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a third-party account.\\nIf you sign into a service offered by a third party with your Microsoft account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.\\n\\nLearn more\\nTop of page\\nCollection of data from children\\nFor users under the age specified by law in your jurisdiction, for example under 13 in the U.S., certain Microsoft products and services will either block users under that age or will ask them to provide consent or authorisation from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is required to provide for the product.\\n\\nOnce parental consent or authorisation is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account. The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages. Parents or guardians can change or revoke the consent choices previously made. Learn more about parental consent and Microsoft child accounts.\\n\\nAs the organiser of a Microsoft family group, the parent or guardian can manage a child’s information and settings on their Family Safety page and view and delete a child’s data on their privacy dashboard.

This could enable us to show you ads about cars.\\nHow to control tailored advertising:\\n\\nYou can control tailored advertising in your account Privacy Settings under 'Tailored Ads'.\\nYou can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode's show description.

This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.\\n\\nMetrics\\n\\nThe following chart contains statistics about global verifiable requests we received from consumers between 1 January and 31 December 2021:\\n\\nType of request\\tReceived\\tComplied\\tDenied\\tAverage response rate\\nRight to Know / Access\\n\\n457,465\\n\\n457,465\\n\\n0\\n\\n4 days\\n\\nRequest to Delete\\n\\n2,298,607\\n\\n2,298,607\\n\\n0\\n\\n15.5 days\\n\\n3.

Data retention\\nWe keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:\\n\\nmaintaining the performance of the Spotify Service\\nmaking data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings\\ncomplying with our legal obligations\\nresolving disputes\\nHere are some of the categories of our retention periods:\\n\\nData retained until you remove it\\nIt's your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See the section on 'Deletion' in Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls' for more information.\\n\\nData that expires after a specific period of time\\nWe have set certain retention periods so that some data expires after a specific period of time.\\n\\nData retained until your Spotify account is deleted\\nWe keep some data until your Spotify account is deleted. When your Spotify account is deleted, your data is deleted or anonymized.\\n\\nData retained for extended time periods for limited purposes\\nAfter your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes.\\n\\nCriteria used to determine the retention periods include:\\n\\nWhat is the appropriate retention period to carry out our purpose? Our systems are designed to automatically 'age out' data based on a defined retention period. We choose the retention period based on its legitimate business purpose.\\nDo we need to keep data to ensure the service that users expect? We keep personal data for an appropriate period to deliver a personalized service to our users over time. We typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalized recommendations that take listening habits into account. For example, Your Summer Rewind and the end-of-year Wrapped campaign.\\nAre users able to update or delete the data themselves? Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses.\\nDo we need to keep the data to uphold our rules and keep our service safe? We may keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This is:\\nto help ensure user safety\\nto protect against harmful content on our platform\\nto take action with reports of intellectual property infringement\\nThis also helps us investigate potential breaches of our User Guidelines and Platform Rules.\\n\\nIs Spotify subject to a legal or contractual obligation to keep or delete the data? Examples include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation or data kept for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.\\n7. Transfer to other countries\\nBecause of the global nature of our business, Spotify shares personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.\\n\\nWhenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:\\n\\nmake sure the data transfer complies with applicable law\\nhelp to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU\\nTo ensure each data transfer complies with applicable EU legislation, we use the following legal mechanisms:\\n\\nStandard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs'). These clauses require the other party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections. For example, we use SCCs to transfer the personal data described in Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you' to our hosting provider which uses servers in the US. You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us or the third party who processes your personal data.\\nAdequacy Decisions. This means that we transfer personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area which have adequate laws to protect personal data, as determined by the European Commission. For example, we transfer the personal data described in Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you' to vendors based in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea and Switzerland.\\nWe also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:\\n\\ntechnical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymization\\npolicies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests\\n8. Keeping your personal data safe\\nWe're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.\\n\\nWe have put various safeguards in place to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies.\\n\\nTo protect your user account, we encourage you to:\\n\\nuse a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account\\nnever share your password with anyone\\nlimit access to your computer and browser\\nlog out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device\\nread more detail on protecting your account\\nYou can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on your account page.\\n\\nIf other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.\\n\\nIt's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalized recommendations and be included in your data download.\\n\\n9. Children\\nNote: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the Spotify Kids Privacy Policy says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.\\n\\nThe Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:\\n\\nis under the age of 13 years\\nmakes it illegal to process their personal data, or\\nrequires parental consent to process their personal data\\nWe do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a Spotify Kids account.\\n\\nIf you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, contact us.\\n\\nIf we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.\\n\\nWhen using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.\\n\\n10. Changes to this Policy\\nWe may occasionally make changes to this Policy.\\n\\nWhen we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.\\n\\n11.

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\\n\\n\\nPrivacy Checkup\\n\\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\\n\\nTake the Privacy Checkup\\n\\nEffective December 15, 2022 | Archived versions | Download PDF\\n\\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\\n\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.\\n\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\n\\n\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\n\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\n\\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\n\\nThings you create or provide to us\\n\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\n\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\n\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\n\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\n\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\n\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\\n\\nYour activity\\n\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\n\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\n\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\\n\\n\\nGo to Google Account\\n\\nYour location information\\n\\nWe collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location.\\n\\nYour location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:\\n\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\n\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\n\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\n\\n\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\n\\nProvide our services\\n\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\n\\nMaintain & improve our services\\n\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\n\\nDevelop new services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\n\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\n\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\n\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\n\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\n\\nGo to My Ad Center\\n\\nMeasure performance\\n\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\n\\nCommunicate with you\\n\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\n\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\n\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\n\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\n\\nWe may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\n\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\n\\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\n\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\n\\n\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\n\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\n\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\n\\nPrivacy controls\\n\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\n\\nGo to Activity Controls\\n\\n\\nAd settings\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\n\\nGo to My Activity\\n\\n\\nGoogle Dashboard\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\n\\nGo to Dashboard\\n\\n\\nYour personal information\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\n\\nGo to Personal Info\\n\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\n\\nSigned-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\nYouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\nAd Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\nExporting, removing & deleting your information\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\n\\n\\nExport your data\\n\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\n\\nDelete your content from specific Google services\\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\nDelete your entire Google Account\\n\\nDelete your information\\n\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\n\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\n\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\n\\nBrowser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\nDevice-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\n\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\n\\nWhen Google shares your information\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\n\\nWith your consent\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\n\\nWith domain administrators\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\n\\nAccess and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\nView statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\nChange your account password\\nSuspend or terminate your account access\\nReceive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\nRestrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\nFor external processing\\nWe provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

However, our content recommendations system does not infer or attach socio-demographic information (like gender or race) to you. We have a Help article that explains how our content recommendations system works - spoilers: the biggest driver of these recommendations is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You can read the article at netflix.com/recommendations.\\n\\nDisclosure of Information\\n\\nWe disclose your information for certain purposes and to third parties, as described below:\\n\\nThe Netflix family of companies: We share your information among the Netflix family of companies (help.netflix.com/legal/corpinfo) as needed for: providing you with access to our services; providing customer support; making decisions about service improvements; content development; and for other purposes described in the Use of Information section of this Privacy Statement.\\nService Providers: We use other companies, agents or contractors (\"Service Providers\") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you.

Similarly, some of the Netflix game features mentioned above (such as multiplayer gameplay, leaderboards, and game saving options) may require use of a third-party service, which is subject to that service’s terms of use and privacy policy.\\n\\nAccess to Account and Profiles\\n“Remember me” function: For ease of access to your account, you can use the \"Remember me on this device\" function when you log in to the website. This function uses technology that enables us to provide direct account access and to help administer the Netflix service without requiring reentry of any password or other user identification when your browser revisits the service. \\nGiving others access to your account: If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to see shows you have watched, ratings, account information (including your email address or other information in the \"Account\" area of our website), and game related information (such as your in-game name and saved game progress). This remains true even if you use our profiles feature. You might have the option to use seamless account login through the Netflix mobile app, which enables login to the Netflix app on smart TVs, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices on the network to which you are connected. If you use that feature, those devices will remain signed into your account unless you later log out of those devices.\\nProfiles: Profiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized Netflix experience, built around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be provided with notice of collection and use at the time such information is requested (the Profile Privacy Notice applies (help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy)).

We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off.\\n\\nMatched Identifier Communications from Netflix. Some third party sites and apps allow us to reach our users with online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective identifier to the third party. A privacy protective identifier means we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares the privacy protective identifier to identifiers in its database and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send a given promotional communication to you on that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising. You can opt out in the “Marketing Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website.\\n\\nBehavioral Advertising. Behavioral advertisements are those that are selected based on your use and/or interactions with various unaffiliated third party apps or websites across the Internet (behavioral advertising). Netflix can advertise its services using behavioral advertising, and if you are using a browser, then certain cookies and web beacons can be used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes a resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine your likely interests. For your choices about behavioral ads from Netflix, please see the \"Cookies and Internet Advertising\" section (below).\\n\\nCookies and Internet Advertising\\nWe and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various reasons. We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains the types of technologies we use, what they do, and your choices regarding their use. \\n\\nCookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device identifiers\\n\\nCookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.\\n\\nIf you use the Netflix app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the \"Identifier for Advertisers\" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the \"Google Advertising ID\" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant and for analytics and optimization purposes.   \\n\\nWhy does Netflix use these technologies?\\n\\nWe use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to access our services by remembering you when you return; to provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services; to enforce our terms, prevent fraud; to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site; and to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and online ads on third party sites.  \\n\\nTo help you better understand how we use cookies and resettable device identifiers, please see the information below:\\n\\nEssential cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service. \\nPerformance and functionality cookies: These cookies help us to customize and enhance your online experience with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors\\' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.\\nAdvertising cookies and resettable device identifiers: These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you and for analytics and optimization purposes.\\nWhen we advertise our services on other websites or apps, some of the websites and apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology companies that we  use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our  advertisements (collectively “Advertising Partners”), may receive information from us as part of our campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and site visit or app open/install information). Common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service. Another common use is to make sure we do not serve ads trying to get individuals to sign up for the Netflix service if they are already a Netflix user. Netflix uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs you land on, or shows you have watched on our service. We do not share information about title selections or your shows you have watched on our service.\\n\\nHow can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?\\n\\nTo exercise choice regarding cookies\\nFor more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third party websites or online services for online behavioral advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here. At this time, we do not respond to web browser \"do not track\" signals.\\n\\nTo exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers\\nTo opt out of behavioral ads from Netflix in connection with a resettable device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under \"privacy\" or \"ads\" in your device\\'s settings). You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be selected based on your likely interests.\\n\\nTo exercise choice regarding other technologies\\nThere are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser\\'s help function or support area to learn more. Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.\\n\\nYour Information and Rights\\nYou can request access to your personal information, or correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate personal information we hold about you. You may also request that we delete personal information that we hold about you.\\n\\nWhen you visit the \"Account\" portion of our website, where you have the ability to access and update a broad range of information about your account, including your contact information, your Netflix payment information, and various related information about your account (such as the content you have viewed and rated).

Specifically, we retain information for our legitimate interests and essential business purposes, such as operating, maintaining and improving our services; complying with our legal obligations; and exercising our legal rights and remedies, including enforcing our terms of use. Our retention of information is based on many factors such as your relationship with Netflix (for example, are you a Netflix current member); the nature of the information; compliance with our legal obligations; defending or resolving actual or anticipated legal claims. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required. For information about deletion, removal and retention of information, please reference this help article: help.netflix.com/node/100625.\\n\\nSecurity\\nWe use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information.\\n\\nOther Websites, Platforms and Applications\\nThe Netflix service may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as the display of social media content, or the provision of voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ from ours. For example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of other Internet connected devices.

Payment Card and Billing Information\\nWhen you purchase a subscription package using one or more of our payment gateway service providers, or any other online or mobile payment services provider we may use (including through any app stores), the following payment information will be collected: your credit/debit card details (number, card expiry date, CVC code) or other bank account details along with the date, time and amount of the transaction payment. This payment information is stored by our payment processors and associated with a merchant name/ID and location which our payment processor gives to us, together with a unique customer ID which we share with them but this payment information is never stored or processed by us. Our payment processors use this payment information to process and facilitate the payment of your subscription fee in order that we may provide you with the service you have requested or to enter into a contract with you to access the Platform (in other words to perform the contract). So that we know you have paid your subscription fee our payment processors will send us a unique transaction ID which we associate with your unique customer ID and which we keep for internal accounting purposes because we have a legal obligation to do so.\\n\\nOur payment processors may use third party fraud detection software or providers which analyse your payment information in order to make automated decisions as to whether or not payment from you will be accepted. You have the right to contest any fraud decision made about you and to be given more information about why any such decision was made by contacting us.\\n\\nWhere you pay a third party for your subscription package (e.g. an app store like Apple App Store) your payment information is directly collected and controlled by that third party. However, we receive invoice receipts from third parties for your subscription purchase and these receipts are stored by us as we have a legitimate business interest to keep them for internal accounting and tax purposes and to comply with our legal obligation as per any applicable laws including any audits, legal proceedings and/or investigations.\\n\\nWhere our payment processors are providing payment processing services to us we put in place appropriate contracts to protect your personal information. For the following aspects of the payment processing our payment processor may act as a controller of your payment information (identified and listed above): providing the payment processing services to you at your request,):, monitoring, preventing and detecting fraudulent payment transactions, complying with legal or regulatory obligations which apply to the financial services sector and analysing, developing and improving their products and services. Our payment processors have their own privacy policies in place and we recommend you read those policies before you provide your payment information.\\n\\nIn order to process any of your customer support queries related to payment processing, our payment processors give us access to the first 6 digits and last 4 digits of your credit/debit card (including any updates) so that we can perform the contract with you and provide you with a quick resolution of your queries. We also use the first 6 digits of your credit/debit card so that, on the basis of our legitimate business interest, we can analyse the most popular card types and issuing banks of our customer base to ensure that we are able to improve our user experience and provide you better service. Our payment processors will also pass us your expiry date after each payment transaction is completed and we will use this to send you an email reminder to update your payment information before your card expires as we believe we have a legitimate interest to make sure your access to the Platform is not interrupted, you can still cancel at any time. However, at no point in time do we have access to or store the full credit/debit card number in our systems.\\n\\n5. Purposes of processing\\nWe will only collect and process Personal Information about You where we have lawful basis to do so.

But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\nDevice-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\n\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\n\\nWhen Google shares your information\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\n\\nWith your consent\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.\\n\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\n\\nMeet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\nEnforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\\nDetect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\nProtect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\n\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\n\\n\\nKEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE\\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\\n\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\n\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\n\\nWe use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\nWe offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\nWe review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\nWe restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\n\\nEXPORTING & DELETING YOUR INFORMATION\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\n\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\n\\n\\nExport your data\\n\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\n\\nDelete your content from specific Google services\\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\nDelete your entire Google Account\\n\\nDelete your information\\n\\nRETAINING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\n\\nSome data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents.

            "(23, 'Media', 'Dailymotion', 'Privacy Policy\\nLast Update: February 23rd, 2023\\n\\nDailymotion respects your privacy and has developed this Privacy Policy to present our commitment to protecting your privacy and to explain how we collect, use, and share Personal Data from or about you in connection with your use of the Dailymotion Service.\\n\\nIf you reside in a country that is part of the European Economic Area (including in the United Kingdom), or Switzerland (collectively referred to as “EEA”), any reference to “Dailymotion“, “we“, “us“, or “our” in this Privacy Policy will always refer to “Dailymotion SA” whose details are provided here.\\n\\nIf you reside in a country that is not part of the European Economic Area or Switzerland, any reference to “Dailymotion“, “we“, “us“, or “our” in this Privacy Policy will always refer to “Dailymotion Inc.” whose details are provided here.\\n\\nWe encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the Dailymotion Service or transacting business with us.\\n\\nDEFINITIONS\\nThe terms “Dailymotion Service” or “Service” refer to the following: the Dailymotion principal website accessible at www.dailymotion.com and at any of its local versions (the “Dailymotion Site“), the Dailymotion secondary websites (“Secondary Sites”), the Dailymotion video player when it is embedded onto any website (the “Video Player“), the Dailymotion apps and web-apps (the “Dailymotion Applications”) as accessible via any current or future device capable of distributing the Dailymotion Site and/or the Video Player, together with any Dailymotion products, content, channels, software, data feeds, services and functionality.\\n\\n“Commercial Partner” refers to entities Dailymotion may cooperate with while carrying out its Services. In particular, Commercial Partners may include content creators, advertisers, media agencies and other actors of the on-line marketing sector. Dailymotion belongs to the Vivendi group of companies. Some of the Commercial Partners may also be fully owned by the Vivendi group and thus will also be considered as Dailymotion’s affiliates.\\n\\n“Content” refers to videos uploaded on the Service, by the Users or by members of the “Partner Program”.\\n\\nThe terms “Personal Data,”  “Data Controller,” “Joint Controller,” “Data Processor” and “Processing” used in the present Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), or unless, otherwise stated herein, under applicable local data protection laws. Personal Data processed by Dailymotion is referred to as “Data”.\\n\\n1. General Information\\n1.1. Dailymotion’s Role in Processing of Personal Data\\nCertain Data from or about you may be collected or otherwise processed when you use the Dailymotion Service, regardless of whether you do so as a Viewer, Visitor, User, or member of the “Partner Program” (as defined in the Dailymotion Terms of Use). \\n\\nIf you reside in a country that is part of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the GDPR is applicable to the collection of your Personal Data. If you reside outside of the European Economic Area, local privacy laws are applicable to such collection, generally those of your country of residence.\\n\\nDailymotion is a Data Controller when we process your Data based on purposes that we define and using the means we choose. \\n\\nWe may contract with some service providers to help us implement certain aspects of your Data Processing. In doing so, these service providers act on our behalf following our instructions and thus are considered our Data Processors.\\n\\nDailymotion is a Joint Data Controller when Dailymotion and its Commercial Partners process your Personal Data together for a common purpose and using the means we jointly choose.\\n\\nOur Commercial Partners are independent Data Controllers when they (or their respective Data Processors) process Your Personal Data (for purposes that they define by themselves.  Depending on the applicable local laws and existing technical protocols, Dailymotion’s role is limited to the collection of your consent on behalf of these Commercial Partners, and to the transmission of collected consent to them and providing you with access to their respective privacy policies and consent management mechanisms. \\n\\nDailymotion is a Data Processor when Dailymotion participates in the implementation of some Personal Data Processing operations carried out by our Commercial Partners, who remain Data Controllers.\\n\\n1.2. Legal Grounds for Processing Personal Data\\n1.2.1. Legal Grounds\\nThe GDPR provides several legal basis upon which Dailymotion can rely for Processing of Personal Data, namely consent, contractual necessity, compliance with a legal obligation, vital interests of data subjects, public interest or legitimate interest. Similarly, applicable laws may provide for equivalent or additional legal grounds, as explained further below in the country specific paragraphs under Section 8.\\n\\nDailymotion Service offers access to Content in association with ads. Presence of both, Content and ads is an essential and non-dissociable part of our Service. Consequently, when we use your Personal Data to display Content and ads we rely on contract as legal ground.\\n\\nWhen Processing your Personal Data requires your consent, ex. when your Personal Data is to be used to target the ads that are shown to you to your interests, we ask you to communicate your consent via a positive action (e.g. by clicking the “Accept” button on our Site, Secondary Site or Video Player or through another method defined under the applicable laws). When Processing of Your Personal Data is based on legal grounds other than ‘consent’, we provide you with information regarding the applicable legal ground.\\n\\n1.2.2. Transparency & Consent Framework\\nDailymotion participates in the “Transparency & Consent Framework” (“TCF”), developed by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) for the purpose of GDPR compliance and applies its Specifications and Policies. We operate a TCF-compliant Consent Management Platform (IAB / TCF identification number 105) for the consent collection and management for Dailymotion’s and our Commercial Partners’ data processing activities in connection with Dailymotion Service and, in general, for the communication of users’ consent to our Commercial Partners.  Dailymotion is also registered with the IAB as a Vendor (IAB / TCF identification number 573). Being an IAB Vendor allows us to confine the collection of consent to the editors of websites or applications that integrate the Dailymotion Player and who participate in the TCF. If you visit such website, the cookie banner used by its publisher collects consent for that publisher and for other entities that a publisher communicates to you through such banner.\\n\\n1.2.3. Refusal or Opposition to Processing\\nWhen Processing is based on consent or legitimate interest, You can always choose not to consent to Processing of some of your Data, withdraw your consent, or oppose to such Processing (unless the applicable laws authorize us not to take into account such decision) as further explained herein. However, this may limit your ability to take full advantage of the many features we offer and, consequently, deteriorate your user experience. Furthermore, Dailymotion Service offers to Visitors access to a multitude of videos without charging a corresponding fee. This is possible only by associating advertisements to the available videos. Content and ads are both integral parts of our Service and the Dailymotion Service cannot exist without either of them. Not consenting to Processing of your Data will not eliminate or limit the number of ads you are shown; it may simply result in ads which are more repetitive and likely less interesting to you.\\n\\n1.3. Transfer of Data\\nThe Data collected by us through our Service may be sent to and stored on servers located in data centers primarily located in France, or in the United States and Singapore.\\n\\nDailymotion Data Processors, be it Dailymotion’s subsidiaries or companies we contract with for certain Processing operations, may process the Data outside of your country of residence. When applicable, we ensure that legally required, appropriate contractual mechanisms are present prior to transfers of Data outside of your country of residence. In particular, when Data of EEA residents is transferred outside of the EEA to a country that European Union authorities do not consider as offering an equivalent level of protection, such transfer  relies on the European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses or on Binding Corporate Rules.\\n\\n2. Data we collect\\nWe may collect Personal Data that can identify you directly, such as your name and email address, and other information that does not identify you directly. This Section explains what Personal Data we collect (2.1) and how we collect such information (2.2).\\n\\nPlease note that we may collect Data concerning yourself either during your use of the Dailymotion Site and Dailymotion Applications, or when you use our embedded Video Player on third-party websites or third-party applications.\\n\\n2.1. Categories of Data We Collect\\n2.1.1. Data You Provide to Us\\nWe collect Personal Data you provide to us when you interact with the Dailymotion Service, including when you sign up for an account, upload Content, create a playlist or share a playlist with others. For instance, when you register to use the Dailymotion Service, you may provide your name, email address, birthdate, gender, and other similar information. If you are a member of the Dailymotion Partner Program, Dailymotion may also collect your payment information, such as your address, bank account or online payment system details and authentication information, as well as billing and contact details depending on the payment system you choose. Note that we do not collect your credit card details. In addition, Dailymotion may collect information you provide to us when you respond to surveys, set your preferences on the Dailymotion Service, directly contact Dailymotion through the Dailymotion Help Center or by other means, or agree to participate in promotions that Dailymotion may offer from time to time. To help you manage your account access rights, Dailymotion  allows multiple log-in accounts to be set up under one Partner account. Consequently, we may collect information you provide to us if you create such log-in accounts.\\n\\n2.1.2. Usage and Log Data\\nWe collect information when you use the Dailymotion Service or view Dailymotion ads outside of the Dailymotion Service. We may also collect information from or about the computers, phones, tablets, or other devices where you install Dailymotion Applications or otherwise access the Dailymotion Service, depending on the permissions you have granted. Such information may include your IP address, your device ID, the settings of the browser and operating system you use (such as type and version of an operating system or its language settings), your activity on the Dailymotion Service including information about the videos you watch on the Service (e.g. video titles and categories), about the ads you are being shown and your interaction with them, the frequency and duration of your activities, page views, referral URLs, network state, and carrier information.\\n\\n2.1.3. Account Data from Third-Party Services \\nIf you choose to log-in, access or otherwise connect to the Dailymotion Service or contact Dailymotion through a third-party service (e.g. Facebook), such method being completely optional and subject to your exclusive decision, we may, in order to execute your choice of a log-in or contact method, collect your email, gender, birthday as well as any other information you make public using that service. Depending on the third-party log-in service used and its current implementation policies, we may also collect additional information you have authorized the third-party service to share with us (such as, for example, your user ID, billing information, etc.).\\n\\n2.1.4. Third-Party Data\\nWe may, if you authorized such third parties to share such information with us or if otherwise authorized by  the applicable laws, receive from them or share with them information about you originating from other sources, such as data aggregators, public databases, and our Commercial Partners, whether affiliated or unaffiliated entities. Shared data (whether identified, pseudonymized or anonymous and whether collected online or offline) may include information about your interests, demographic data, purchasing behavior, and your online activities (such as websites you have visited and/or advertisements you have viewed).\\n\\nWe may combine the shared information with the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in Section 3 of the Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by law.\\n\\n2.2. How is the Data Collected?\\nLike many online services, we use, directly or via our subcontractors, various technologies to collect usage data and store your user settings. The Data thus collected helps us propose, protect and improve the Dailymotion Service and personalize your user experience, for example, by enabling you to access videos in a language corresponding to your browser’s settings or in a format compatible with your device.   \\n\\nDespite the variety of the actual measures deployed, the various technologies used to collect data are commonly referred to as “cookies” and their use is regulated by “cookie laws.” Whenever applicable laws subject the use of cookies to user consent, Dailymotion asks for your consent prior to their use.\\n\\nA “cookie” is a small data file that is installed on your device. A cookie lifespan is limited to its purpose and does not, in general, exceed 13 months. A cookie expires upon the end of its validity period. A cookie may be deleted before the end of its validity period if you or the technologies you use (e.g. your operating system) do so. The different categories of cookies and assimilated technologies we use are further described below. More detailed information about the use of cookies in connection with advertising on the Dailymotion Service is provided under Section 3.\\n\\nTo learn more about our cookie management rules, please refer to our Cookie Policy. Depending on the country you reside in, you may, at any time, manage your cookie settings and choose the purposes for which you consent to or refuse the use of cookies by accessing the “Manage Cookies” section available on our Service within the EEA.\\n\\nCookies and Local Storage\\nWe may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to offer you a high quality Service, better understand how you interact with the Dailymotion Service or with marketing material advertising the Dailymotion Service outside of our Service; to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Dailymotion Service; to use technical and automated means to display Content and advertising  based on your Data; to respect the rights of the Content rights holders or that of advertisers and to be in conformity with obligations imposed by applicable laws. We may create a unique device or user ID (“Service ID”) for you and store it in a cookie so we can customize your experience based on your preferences. These uses allow us to create a better experience for you on the Dailymotion Service.\\n\\nWe may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also referred to as “Flash cookies“) and HTML5 local storage, including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the Video Player.\\n\\nMost Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. By changing your browser settings, you can instruct your browser to stop accepting all or some cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. For further information on disabling cookies or deleting information contained in cookies in general, please click here. Please note that disabling cookies or deleting information contained in cookies or Flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of the Dailymotion Service, including the Video Player. For example, we may not be able to store your preferences (such as the language to be used by the Service) or login information (such as keeping your connection session active thus allowing you to be automatically recognized by the Dailymotion Service when you repeatedly access it through the same device) or use technical means to display  Content and advertising based on your online viewing habits.\\n\\nWeb Beacons, Pixels and other Trackers\\nWeb beacons or pixel tags are similar to cookies and can be embedded within web pages, videos, or emails. These technologies are mainly used to learn whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email message; and determine other usage details including the time and date on which you viewed Content, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Content was viewed.\\n\\nMobile Device Identifiers and Software Development Kits (“SDKs”)\\nWe may use or work with third parties, including our Commercial Partners and service providers, who use mobile SDKs to collect information such as advertising identifiers (e.g., “ad-ID” or “IDFA”) and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Dailymotion Service. An SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented (a mobile SDK is a mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon, described above). For instance, we may use this technology to analyze how you interact with Content and advertisements and to enable analytics or other features through mobile devices.\\n\\n3. PURPOSES FOR DATA PROCESSING\\n3.1. Purposes for which Data is Processed by Dailymotion\\n3.1.1. General\\nWe receive or collect Data, either directly or via our service providers, because we are passionate about creating an engaging and relevant experience for our users, and to ensure that the rights of Content right holders and advertisers are respected. We may also share some of your data with Dailymotion’s affiliated companies (Vivendi group’s wholly owned companies) or with other Commercial Partners to better understand what you may be interested in.\\n\\nWe use all of the legitimately collected or received information to help us provide and support the Dailymotion Service with a first-class user experience that is adapted to each user’s tastes, as varied as they may be. The way we use the Data about you depends on how you use the Dailymotion Service.\\n\\nNote that videos accessible on our Service, be it Content or video ads, do not belong to Dailymotion. Instead, they are provided by various right holders who, by sharing their videos on Dailymotion Service, decide which of their videos they make available to you.\\n\\nAs a content hosting platform Dailymotion does not curate the videos that are accessible to you. It means that we do not have a team of content editors proposing video selections to you that they believe are adapted to your individual taste.\\n\\nOur Service offers videos in multiple languages that can be accessed from a number of electronic devices and through different browsers. We use cookies to detect the linguistic and technical settings of your device and browser to show you videos that correspond to your device setting, i.e. in the language your browser is set to and in a format your device is capable of accessing.\\n\\nYou will find in the present Section detailed information about the different purposes your Data is processed for.\\n\\n3.1.2. Purposes for which Data is Processed\\nDailymotion may process the Data for the following purposes:\\n\\nProvide, Improve and Develop the Dailymotion Service. We are able, through technical and automated algorithms, to deliver the Service and to display Content and advertisements based on your Data collected on our Service. We analyze such Data to understand how you use and interact with the Dailymotion Service and discover the things you’re interested in on and off our Service and ultimately provide you with the best user experience we can offer. For example, we collect your authentication data to allow you to connect to your account, and we collect information on your language setting preferences to provide you with the Dailymotion Service in the language of your choice. We may conduct surveys and research, test features in development and analyze the information that we have in order to evaluate and improve our existing products and services, develop new offerings or features and conduct maintenance and troubleshooting activities.\\nCommunicate with You. We may use your Data to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about the Dailymotion Service and update you about our policies and terms. We also may use your information to respond to you when you contact us, or for any other purpose that is disclosed to you at the time we collect the Data or that is related to a request made by you or related to you. To learn about opting out of promotional communications, please see the information we have provided in Section 8 below (“Your Privacy Rights”).\\nShow and Adapt Ads. Dailymotion offers its users the opportunity to watch numerous videos without charging any fee in return. Such free of charge service can only be possible thanks to the presence of advertisements. We may use Data we have, including information received from our Commercial Partners, to evaluate and improve our advertising and analytics systems so that the ads shown to you on and off our Services are customized and of real interest to you.  We also use Data to limit the quantity of advertisements you are shown on our Service to allow you to fully enjoy the Content. By processing some of your Data we also measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services. Your Data may be shared with our Commercial Partners to inform them about your decision whether or not to allow processing of your Personal Data and, if you agreed, to allow them to estimate whether the products or service for which they run advertising campaigns may be of interest to you. To learn about opting out of interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please see the information we have provided in Section 8 below (“Your Privacy Rights”) or exercise your choices via Dailymotion’s “Manage Cookies” section available on our Service, provided that you reside in the EEA.\\nPay You.  If you are a member of the Dailymotion Partner Program, we use your billing information, such as your billing address or payment methods details, to proceed with payment of sums generated under our Partner Program monetization features. If you choose a third-party payment method, we will communicate to the payment service provider of your choice all information necessary to process due payments and may receive from such payment service provider the receiving account details and related payment confirmations. The exact information communicated or received depend on the payment service provider chosen, the payable amounts and then-current requirements of laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions. Note that we do not use or otherwise access your credit card information.\\nIdentify Your Geographic Location. We may collect your device’s location data (limited to the city level only). This information not only allows us to serve you Content related to your local area, such as local news and sports videos, but enables us to ensure the respect of Content geo-restrictions imposed by the Content right holders.

As part of this effort, Dailymotion may offer to content partners, subject to specific financial conditions, the possibility to use our Video Player for distributing Content without any advertising being associated to it (the “Enterprise Solution Video Player”).  \\n\\nContent Partners having chosen this new solution (“Clients”) integrate this Enterprise Solution Video Player on their websites or their other digital properties (ex: mobile applications) and pick Content they wish to make available to you.  \\n\\nWhen Clients use the Enterprise Solution Video Player, Dailymotion remains Data Controller for the cookies deployed by that player and related processing of your Personal Data.

When applicable, the disclosed Data contains information about your privacy choices, i.e. about the purposes you consented your Data to be Processed for.\\n\\nWe may also share the same information listed above  with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed its ads or installed an app after seeing an ad. We can also provide such advertiser with non-personally identifying demographic information (such as a the following categorizations: female between 25 and 30 years of age, living in New York) to these advertisers to help them understand their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by strict confidentiality obligations.\\n\\nWhen disclosed Data is used by a Commercial Partner for its own purposes, it is that Commercial Partner who is the Data Controller for the Processing it undertakes.\\n\\nDailymotion works with a large number of Commercial Partners. The list of Dailymotion’s Commercial Partners is published on our Service and may be consulted at all times from within the “Manage Cookies” section. Note that it does not mean that when you watch a video on our Service all of these Commercial Partners process your Personal Data.

These purposes may include the development, improvement and delivery of their services, audience and service analytics, personalization and adaptation to your centers of interest of their content, commercial offerings and ads, whether on or outside of the Dailymotion Service,  conformity with their respective contractual and legal obligations, such as, for example, geographic restrictions of their content exploitation rights, calculation of applicable fees or anti-fraud measures. You may learn more about each Commercial Partner’s Processing purposes and legal ground(s) by accessing their IAB Vendor registrations or privacy policies through links available within the “Manage Cookies” section of our Service accessible from the EEA.\\n\\nWhen our Commercial Partners’ collection  or processing of your Personal Data depends on your consent, Dailymotion asks you for such consent on behalf of our Commercial Partners.

You may also exercise your right by accessing the Commercial Partners’ respective privacy policies, as accessible from  the Commercial Partners List.\\n\\nNote that refusing the use of your Personal Data for ad-targeting purposes will not block advertisements. You will still see ads, but they will be less pertinent to your interests.\\n\\nIf you wish to learn more about the purposes for which our Commercial Partners process your Personal Data and the legal grounds such processing  can be based on, we advise you to read their respective privacy policies. For reasons inherent to the dynamic character of the online activities, this list of Dailymotion Commercial Partners may evolve. The list will be updated periodically, and we invite you to consult it regularly for the most up-to-date information.\\n\\n4. DATA RECIPIENTS\\nWe may share personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information collected from or about you with third parties, or allow you to share your personal information with third parties, such as social networks, as explained further below (“Data Recipients”). We require such Data Recipients to adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements that we may enter into with them.\\n\\n4.1. Third Party Login Services\\nIf you connect to the Dailymotion Service through your Facebook or Google accounts, you may choose to share information about your activities on the Dailymotion Service with Facebook or Google. Furthermore, if you visit Dailymotion while logged-in to Facebook or Google, then those entities may record your browser details and combine technical information from your web browser with other information that each of them already knows about you. Your decision to share information about your activities on the Dailymotion Service within your Facebook or Google account may result in Dailymotion sending relevant information about you to Facebook or Google. Facebook or Google may then make that information visible to its own users in accordance with applicable law, its own data and privacy policies, and your Facebook or Google privacy settings. We recommend you familiarize yourself with Facebook’s and Google’s respective data and privacy policies and available account privacy controls. We remind you that Dailymotion is independent from these third-party companies and that any privacy settings you might have chosen on the Dailymotion Service are not applicable on Facebook, Google or any other social network account.\\n\\n4.2. Commercial Partners\\nWe work with a number of Commercial Partners who help us offer and improve the Dailymotion Service. Such Commercial Partners include, for example, Content uploaders,  and other actors of the digital industry. We may disclose information collected from or about you to such Commercial Partners (or their authorized service providers) when we are legally authorized to do so, but such disclosure is always accompanied by appropriate technical, organizational or contractual measures aimed at ensuring the integrity and security of your information (e.g., aggregation, anonymization, etc.).\\n\\nIn particular, we may share information, generally in the aggregated, encrypted or anonymized form, about you with advertisers and advertising-related service providers, for the purposes described above under Section 3.2, including for technical reasons (e.g., to deliver advertising videos on your screen), to make ads relevant and interesting to you or measure and improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Note that we do not share directly identifiable information about you (such as your email address) with advertisers and advertising-related service providers.\\n\\n4.3. Service Providers\\nLike most companies, we contract with third parties to provide us with specialized services in connection with our business activities. The services we contract vary and evolve in time and include:  payment solutions (e.g. PayPal or Payoneer), analyzing and processing data (e.g. provision of analytics software that helps us  improve ads relevancy), hosting our websites and the content, providing customer support, communicating with you  (e.g. email or push notification systems) or otherwise help us provide the Dailymotion Service.\\n\\nWhen the delivery of these services requires so (and if you consented so or if we are otherwise authorized to do so), we share some of your Data with our Service Providers. Our Service Providers commit to confidentiality obligations in conformity with the present Privacy Policy and with the contracts we sign with them.\\n\\n4.4. Audience Measurement Providers\\nOur Commercial Partners, such as content providers and advertisers, seek to measure the performance of their videos across many platforms, including the Dailymotion Service. Accordingly, Dailymotion may use and permit the use on its Service of independent, industry-standard, third-party measurement solutions (e.g. Nielsen or comScore) that enables us or our Business Partners to include your video views in our or their measurement statistics. We may also share our own usage statistics, in anonymized or aggregated form, with these Business Partners.\\n\\nTo learn more about your choices with respect to audience measurement software, please see the information we have provided in Section 8 (“Your Privacy Rights”).\\n\\n4.5. Public Authorities and Legal Counsels\\nIn some instances, we may be required to disclose information from or about you to public authorities or to legal counsels without notifying you or giving you the opportunity to object. We may disclose your information in good-faith to protect the legal rights of Dailymotion, of our affiliates or Commercial Partners, and of each of our respective equity holders, directors, officers, employees, or agents, and technical service providers acting as our processors or sub-processors; to protect the safety and security of our users   or of third parties; to enforce our Terms of Use; to prevent fraud; for risk management purposes; and to comply with or respond to the law, a legal process, or a request for cooperation by a government entity. However, it is Dailymotion’s policy, whenever reasonably possible and legally permissible, to promptly notify you upon receipt of a subpoena or court order requesting your Data and to not produce your Data until we receive such subpoena or court order, so that you will have adequate opportunity to initiate appropriate legal proceedings.\\n\\nFurthermore, if you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by Dailymotion or by another user of the Dailymotion Service, we may provide the Data that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint.\\n\\n4.6. Third Parties in Connection with certain Corporate Transactions\\nIf we sell all or part of our business, make a transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a change-of-control transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer or share information from or about you to one or more third parties as part of the transaction, including as part of the due diligence process. In such case, your Data would be transferred or shared only as an integral part of the underlying transfer of the Dailymotion Service (or part thereof) and not sold separately to third parties.\\n\\n4.7. Parties you Consented to or to whom you Choose to Share Your Data\\nCertain functions within the Dailymotion Service may give you the option to share videos through our Video Player, along with any information you want to share, for example, through your own websites, applications or social network channels, such as Facebook or Twitter.\\n\\nIf you hold an account with Facebook or Twitter, you may choose to share information about a video on the Dailymotion Service with Facebook or Twitter users by using the dedicated sharing feature on our Service. Such sharing is only possible while you are logged-in to your Facebook or Twitter accounts. Your decision to share information about a video on the Dailymotion Service may result in Dailymotion sending relevant information about you to Facebook or Twitter. Facebook and Twitter, pursuant to their respective data and privacy policies and to your Facebook or Twitter privacy settings, may process your Personal Data relevant to the sharing of such video.\\n\\nLastly, we may also share any information from or about you with any party when we have your consent or when you otherwise choose to share such information (e.g. sharing your contact information to an uploader whose content you have reported on our Service, if necessary, or sharing your information in the scope of a marketing study you agreed to participate in, etc.).\\n\\n5. DATA SECURITY AND ACCOUNT ACCESS\\n5.1. Data Security\\nThe security of your Data is important to us. Our goal is to make you feel confident and safe when using the Dailymotion Service.\\n\\nWe use a variety of physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, and modification. For example, we take steps to limit access to sensitive information from or about you to only those Dailymotion employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to access such information. We also use measures like encryption and hashing to help protect sensitive information when in transmission, and firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personal Data. We also use techniques such as data aggregation to render it more difficult to link and trace information to you.\\n\\nDespite these efforts, there is always a possibility that a breach in data transmission or storage may occur. We want you to feel confident in our security when using the Dailymotion Service, but we cannot guarantee the absolute security of Data at all times. We advise you to exercise caution and, in particular, to use a unique password for your Dailymotion account, i.e. a password that you do not use for any other service you have an account with (which could prevent, in the event your Dailymotion password confidentiality is breached, unauthorized access to these other accounts), to change your password if you suspect its fraudulent use and contact us if you notice any suspicious activities on the Dailymotion Service', 0)\n",

In general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user data. We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a specific problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).\\nCustomizing your experience: We use your data to personalize the service to you. This may include remembering your preferences for language or volume or displaying videos that you might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.\\nMarketing and advertising: We use your data to show you ads on third-party sites, and to measure the effectiveness of those ads. \\nExercising our rights: Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise our legal rights and prevent abuse of our service.

For example, we may need to gather your data to respond to a subpoena or court order.\\nProtecting your information: Where appropriate, we may anonymize, backup, and delete certain data.\\nWe may use algorithms and other automated means to implement any of the above.\\n\\nWhenever we process your data for one of these purposes, we have determined that one or more of the following lawful bases apply:\\n\\nPerformance of a contract;\\nLegitimate commercial interest;\\nCompliance with a legal obligation; or\\nConsent\\nIf you require further information about the balancing test that Vimeo has undertaken to justify its reliance on legitimate interest as a lawful basis of processing, see Section 15 for information on how to contact us.\\n\\n5.

If the organization establishes a direct relationship with us, they may convert your personal account to become part of the organization\\'s account. \\n\\nThis means the organization may:\\n\\nAccess information about your account activity;\\nTake control of the account, including any content whether uploaded before or after the date that the organization converts your account to the organization\\'s account; and/or\\nDelete your account.\\nIf you sign up for a Vimeo account using an email address issued to you by an organization, Vimeo may share your personal information (e.g., name, email address) with such organization.

Legal and Safety-Related Disclosures\\nWe may disclose your data in response to official requests (e.g., court orders, subpoenas, search warrants, national security requests, etc.) (\"requests\") that we receive from government authorities or parties to legal proceedings. We direct law enforcement agencies to our Law Enforcement Guidelines page.\\n\\nWe handle U.S. requests in accordance with U.S. law.

In all cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.\\n\\nWe may disclose user data where we reasonably believe that someone\\'s life is at risk. For example, if we become aware of a person threatening to commit suicide, we may share that person\\'s data with appropriate entities that may have the ability to help.\\n\\nWe may disclose user data to report suspected crimes. We report content suspected of exploiting minors to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) along with the data identifying the uploading user.\\n\\nWe may disclose user data in situations involving legal claims against us or one of our users.

If you challenge such a notice, we may share your response with the complainant.\\n\\nWe may share your data with potential transaction partners, advisors, and others in the event our company is, in whole or part, acquired by a third party. In such case, we will use reasonable efforts to require the acquiring entity to comply with this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n7. Data Retention\\nWe retain your data for as long as you have an account. When you close an account, we will delete its content, including its videos. We may retain logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics and security purposes); your email address; your tax information; communications with you; and your transactional information (for auditing, tax, and financial purposes).

We have no control over search engines; however, we will, upon request, send a request for deletion to major search engines.\\n\\nIf we receive legal process pertaining to your account, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with the legal process. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your data to defend or assert our rights.\\n\\n8. Your Privacy Choices\\nWe enable you to make numerous choices about your data:\\n\\nYou may choose not to provide us with certain information. For example, you may choose not to create an account or not to provide optional account information.\\nYou may change your account and video privacy settings. See Section 9 for more details.\\nYou may change or correct information voluntarily submitted to us. We encourage you to keep your data current by viewing your settings page.\\nYou may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us. See Section 10 for more details.\\nYou may limit the use of cookies. See our Cookie Policy for options.\\nYou may backup your videos.\\nYou may close your account (which will delete all videos) or delete certain videos.\\nUsers in certain jurisdictions may have additional rights. See Section 14 for more details.\\n\\n9. Account and Video Privacy Settings\\nAs part of our services we offer you the ability to limit the distribution of your content, including your videos. This section explains some of your choices.\\n\\nProfile\\nSome of our online subscription plans enable you to \"hide\" your profile or otherwise make it inaccessible on our website. Your profile will, however, remain accessible to persons who have access to your account or content.\\n\\nTeam Members\\nSome of our subscription plans enable you to grant account-level access rights to others. Persons with such access (\"Team Members\") may be able to see and potentially alter your data. You may revoke or downgrade Team Member access at any time.\\n\\nVideos\\nWe enable you to manage the privacy settings of your videos. On Vimeo.com, for example, your options, which depend on your subscription plan, may include:\\n\\nPublic: Your video will be publicly-available.\\nPrivate: Your video will be available to you and authorized Team Members.\\nUnlisted: Your video will be available to anyone who has the unique URL.\\nPassword: Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the password you have set.\\nYou may change a video\\'s privacy settings at any time. Changes will be applied on a go-forward basis. \\n\\nYou may create a sharable link to your video for the purpose of sharing your video with others or embedding your video on a third-party website (including your own). Creating such a sharable link will override your privacy settings and will allow anyone who enters the link in a browser to view your video without restriction. Similarly, embedding your video on a publicly-available website will allow the public to view your video regardless of your privacy settings. \\n\\nYou should exercise caution in granting access to others (whether through link sharing or passwords). Once you have granted access to someone else, you lose a degree of control over the distribution of your video as those persons may share the password and/or link with other people. \\n\\nRegardless of your profile or video privacy settings, Vimeo reserves the right to inspect them for compliance with its Terms of Service, to provide customer support, or to address technical issues.\\n\\n10. Communications from Us\\nEmails\\nIf you create an account, you may receive commercial emails from us. This includes newsletters and offers. You may always opt out from receiving commercial messages in your account settings. Please note that any opt-out request may take several days to process and you will continue to receive transactional emails from us (e.g., emails confirming transactions and/or providing information about your account).\\n\\nMobile Device Communications\\nWe may, with your consent, send push notifications in our apps. You may disable these by declining them or changing the app\\'s settings. To the extent provided, we may, with your consent, send SMS messages to your mobile telephone for authentication and security purposes. You may opt out of receiving such messages at any time.\\n\\n11. Protecting Your Information\\nWe use physical, technical, and organizational security measures to safeguard your data from unauthorized or accidental disclosure. Despite these efforts, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Users also have a role to play in keeping their data safe. We encourage you to use a unique and hard-to-guess password for your account and to not share it with others. You should only grant access rights to people who you know and trust, and, even then, you should be careful in granting all access rights. You should monitor your account regularly. If you believe that someone has gained access to your account without your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can investigate.\\n\\n12. Your Responsibilities\\nYou may receive other people\\'s data in using our service. If you receive information from other users, you must process that information in compliance with your published privacy policy and all applicable laws, including those concerning privacy, data security, and online marketing.\\n\\n13. Third-Party Services\\nWe may provide access to online services that we do not own or operate via hyperlinks or integrations. These services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data they collect. Once on a third-party site, your data may be collected by others. We encourage you to read our Third-Party Service Addendum and the privacy policies of such services before using them.\\n\\nYou may use our service through third-party sites. For example, you may watch a video that is embedded on a third-party site or use one of our apps on a third-party platform. This Privacy Policy covers our apps and video players, but does not cover any third-party site or any third-party video player.\\n\\n14. International Data Transfers and Certain User Rights\\n14.1 Location of Data\\nVimeo is based in the United States. We provide services globally using computer systems, servers, and databases located in the U.S. and other countries. When you use our services from outside of the U.S., your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S.. Please note that U.S. data and privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Residents of certain countries may be subject to additional protections as set forth in Sections 14.2 and 14.3 below.\\n\\n14.2 GDPR (EEA and UK Users)\\nThis Section 14.2 applies only to natural persons residing in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (for the purpose of this section only, \"you\" or \"your\" shall be limited accordingly). It is Vimeo\\'s policy to comply with the EEA\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In accordance with the GDPR, we may transfer your personal information from your home country to the U.S. (or other countries) based upon the following legal bases:\\n\\nLegitimate business interests: We could not provide our services or comply with our legal obligations without transferring your personal information to the U.S.\\nOur use of Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as \"Model Clauses\") where appropriate.\\nYou have the right to: opt out of non-essential cookies (see our Cookie Policy); access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to our use of your personal information; be forgotten; port your data; and withdraw consents. We enable exercise of these rights primarily through our services (which we reserve the right to modify). For example, we allow users to change their information, download their videos, and close their accounts. We also fulfil our obligations in response to direct requests. We will endeavor to process requests within one month. Please note that we may not be able to comply with requests to the extent that they would cause us to violate any law or infringe any other person\\'s rights. We reserve the right to request appropriate identification. We will process requests free of charge unless they would impose an unreasonable cost on us.\\n\\nIf you have a request, complaint or inquiry, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address listed in Section 15. We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any issue. You also have the right to file a complaint with the supervisory data protection authority of your jurisdiction.\\n\\n14.3 California Users\\nUnder California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents have the right to opt out of disclosing information to third parties for the purpose of allowing such third parties to directly market their products and services. At this time, we do not engage in this type of disclosure.\\n\\nUnder the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), California consumers have the following rights, which can be exercised directly or in certain cases, through an authorized agent:\\n\\nRight to Know. You have the right to request information about the categories and sources of personal information we collect, our purposes for collecting the information, and the types of third parties that receive that information. Details about our data collection, use and third-party disclosures can be found here. In addition, you have the right to request a copy of your personal information. You may exercise this right once per 12-month period by using this form.\\n\\nRight to Delete. You have the right to request that we delete some or all of the personal information that we have about you. Deleting all data will typically require the deletion of your account, along with all content, including your videos. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may retain information to provide services you have ordered, complete transactions, honor opt-outs, prevent fraud, spam, and other abuse, comply with our legal obligations, cooperate with law enforcement, and to exercise and defend our rights. You may exercise your right to delete using this form.\\n\\nDo Not Sell. You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information, and to request information about whether we have sold your personal information in the past 12 months. When you use our services, we may share your personal information with advertising partners in a way that may constitute a sale under the CCPA. You may opt out via the link provided on the relevant page or app. If we do not provide an opt-out mechanism, it is because we do not believe in good faith that your personal information is being sold. \\n\\nNon-Discrimination. We won’t discriminate against you because you exercise any rights herein.\\n\\nTo exercise your rights to know and delete, we must be able to verify your identity as the owner of the Vimeo account you are inquiring about. We may not be able to fulfill your request until we can do so. In general, we verify identity by confirming that you are the owner of the email address associated with the account. An authorized agent submitting a request on your behalf must also have access to the email address associated with the account, along with sufficient evidence that you have authorized that person to submit the request on your behalf. Although you need not have a Vimeo account to submit a request, we may not be able to locate certain information to process your request if you don’t have one.\\n\\n14.4 Nevada Users\\nNevada residents have the right to opt out of the sale of certain \"covered information\" collected by operators of websites or online services. We currently do not sell covered information, as \"sale\" is defined by such law, and we don\\'t have plans to sell this information. However, if you would like to be notified if we decide in the future to sell personal information covered by the Act, you can provide us with your name and email address here. You are responsible for updating any change in your email address by the same method and we are not obligated to cross-reference other emails you may have otherwise provided us for other purposes. We will maintain this information and contact you if our plans change. At that time, we will create a process for verifying your identity and providing an opportunity to verified consumers to complete their opt-out. Please become familiar with our data practices as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share your data as explained in this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance your experiences and our services, and those activities will be unaffected by a Nevada do not sell request.\\n\\n15.

Our services include:\\n\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.\\n\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\n\\n\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\n\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\n\\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\n\\nThings you create or provide to us\\n\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\n\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\n\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\n\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\n\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\n\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\\n\\nYour activity\\n\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\n\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\n\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\\n\\n\\nGo to Google Account\\n\\nYour location information\\n\\nWe collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location.\\n\\nYour location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:\\n\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\n\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\n\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\n\\n\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\n\\nProvide our services\\n\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\n\\nMaintain & improve our services\\n\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\n\\nDevelop new services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\n\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\n\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\n\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\n\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\n\\nGo to My Ad Center\\n\\nMeasure performance\\n\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\n\\nCommunicate with you\\n\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\n\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\n\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\n\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\n\\nWe may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\n\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\n\\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\n\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\n\\n\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\n\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\n\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\n\\nPrivacy controls\\n\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\n\\nGo to Activity Controls\\n\\n\\nAd settings\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\\n\\nGo to My Ad Center\\n\\n\\nAbout you\\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\\n\\nGo to About You\\n\\n\\nShared endorsements\\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\\n\\nGo to Shared Endorsements\\n\\n\\nSites and apps that use Google services\\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\\n\\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\\n\\nWays to review & update your information\\n\\nMy Activity\\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\n\\nGo to My Activity\\n\\n\\nGoogle Dashboard\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\n\\nGo to Dashboard\\n\\n\\nYour personal information\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\n\\nGo to Personal Info\\n\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\n\\nSigned-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\nYouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\nAd Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\nExporting, removing & deleting your information\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\n\\n\\nExport your data\\n\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\n\\nDelete your content from specific Google services\\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\nDelete your entire Google Account\\n\\nDelete your information\\n\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\n\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\n\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\n\\nBrowser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\nDevice-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\n\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\n\\nWhen Google shares your information\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\n\\nWith your consent\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\n\\nWith domain administrators\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\n\\nAccess and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\nView statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\nChange your account password\\nSuspend or terminate your account access\\nReceive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\nRestrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\nFor external processing\\nWe provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.\\n\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\n\\nMeet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\nEnforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\\nDetect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\nProtect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\n\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\n\\n\\nKEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE\\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\\n\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\n\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\n\\nWe use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\nWe offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\nWe review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\nWe restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\n\\nEXPORTING & DELETING YOUR INFORMATION\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\n\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\n\\n\\nExport your data\\n\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\n\\nDelete your content from specific Google services\\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\nDelete your entire Google Account\\n\\nDelete your information\\n\\nRETAINING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\n\\nSome data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents.

For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos.

And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\n\\n\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\n\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\n\\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\n\\nThings you create or provide to us\\n\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\n\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\n\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\n\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\n\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\n\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\\n\\nYour activity\\n\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\n\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\n\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\\n\\n\\nGo to Google Account\\n\\nYour location information\\n\\nWe collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location.\\n\\nYour location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:\\n\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\n\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\n\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\n\\n\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\n\\nProvide our services\\n\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\n\\nMaintain & improve our services\\n\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\n\\nDevelop new services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\n\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\n\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\n\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\n\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\n\\nGo to My Ad Center\\n\\nMeasure performance\\n\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\n\\nCommunicate with you\\n\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\n\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\n\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\n\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\n\\nWe may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\n\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\n\\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\n\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\n\\n\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\n\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\n\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\n\\nPrivacy controls\\n\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\n\\nGo to Activity Controls\\n\\n\\nAd settings\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\\n\\nGo to My Activity\\n\\n\\nGoogle Dashboard\\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\\n\\nGo to Dashboard\\n\\n\\nYour personal information\\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\\n\\nGo to Personal Info\\n\\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\\n\\nSigned-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\\nYouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\\nAd Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\\nExporting, removing & deleting your information\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\n\\n\\nExport your data\\n\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\n\\nDelete your content from specific Google services\\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\nDelete your entire Google Account\\n\\nDelete your information\\n\\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\\n\\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\\n\\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\\n\\nBrowser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\nDevice-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\n\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\n\\nWhen Google shares your information\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\n\\nWith your consent\\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\n\\nWith domain administrators\\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\\n\\nAccess and retain information stored in your account, like your email\\nView statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install\\nChange your account password\\nSuspend or terminate your account access\\nReceive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request\\nRestrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings\\nFor external processing\\nWe provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.\\n\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\n\\nMeet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\nEnforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\\nDetect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\nProtect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\n\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\n\\n\\nKEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE\\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\\n\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\\n\\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\\n\\nWe use encryption to keep your data private while in transit\\nWe offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account\\nWe review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems\\nWe restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\n\\nEXPORTING & DELETING YOUR INFORMATION\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\n\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\n\\n\\nExport your data\\n\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\n\\nDelete your content from specific Google services\\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\nDelete your entire Google Account\\n\\nDelete your information\\n\\nRETAINING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\n\\nSome data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents.

You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\n\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\n\\nGo to My Ad Center\\n\\nMeasure performance\\n\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\n\\nCommunicate with you\\n\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\n\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\n\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\n\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\n\\nWe may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\n\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\n\\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\n\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\nDevice-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\n\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity.

For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.\\n\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\n\\nMeet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\nEnforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\\nDetect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\nProtect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders.

We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\n\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\n\\n\\nKEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE\\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\\n\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information.

Sometimes you can limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other users of the service. Such information can appear in search engine results or through other publicly available platforms and can be “crawled” or searched by third parties. For example, when users post content on message boards, online chats, blogs and Community Forums, the information posted by the user will become public. Some online content may remain accessible publicly even after Adobe fulfils a request to delete the poster’s personal information.\\n\\n \\n\\nPlease be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you wouldn’t want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within an app or website that allows you to control who sees what you post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and app, your email address or name and/or profile photo may be included and displayed with your message. You can find more information about managing your public profile here.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo remove content you have shared on our Services and Software, please use the same feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact us.\\n\\nIs my personal information secure?\\nWe work hard to protect your personal information. We employ administrative, technical and physical security controls where appropriate, such as encryption, 2-step verification and appropriate contractual confidentiality obligations for employees and contractors.\\n\\nWhere does Adobe store my personal information?\\nYour personal information and files are stored on Adobe’s servers and the servers of companies we engage to provide services to us.\\n\\n \\n\\nDoes Adobe transfer my personal information across national borders?\\nThe main locations where we process your personal information are the US and India, but we also transfer personal information to all other countries in the world where our Services and Software are available. We carry out these transfers in compliance with applicable laws - for example, by putting data transfer agreements in place to help protect your personal information.\\n \\n\\nIf you reside outside of North America, your relationship is with Adobe Ireland. Where Adobe Ireland transfers your personal information to a country which is not within the EEA and is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we rely on one or more of the following legal mechanisms: European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses and/or your consent in certain circumstances. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review upon request, using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. For more information about how Adobe Ireland transfers European personal information, please see Cross-border data transfers.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe information above applies to Adobe users who are consumers. More information is available for our business customers that want to learn more about Cross-border data transfers.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat rights have I got regarding my personal information and how can I exercise these rights?\\nUnder the law of some jurisdictions, you may have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal information; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal information; and to obtain the personal information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format and to ask us to share (port) this information to another controller. You may be entitled to additional rights based on applicable data privacy laws in your jurisdiction.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances (such as where we are using the information for direct marketing).\\n\\n \\n\\nThese rights may be limited, for example, if fulfill your request would reveal personal information about another person or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or which we need to defend claims against us. In addition, most web browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Currently, there is not an accepted standard on how companies should respond to web browsers’ “Do Not Track” signals. Accordingly, our Services and Software do not currently recognise or respond to “Do Not Track” browser signals. However, you can learn more about Adobe’s advertising practices and your privacy choices here. \\n\\n \\n\\nTo exercise any of these rights (including deactivating your Adobe ID account), you can get in touch with us - or our data protection officer - using the details set out below. Additionally, many of our Services and Software allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the \"my account,\" \"my profile,\" or a similar feature of the service you are using. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our Services and Software by logging in and using the deletion functions that are available.\\n\\n \\n\\nIf you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to report them to your local privacy regulator or data protection authority and, where applicable, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with Adobe Ireland\\'s lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain services or features, those services or features may not be available or fully functional. For example, to register with Adobe, to create an Adobe ID and to use some Adobe Services and Software, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer an Adobe account to you or provide you with the Services and Software requested. Other optional information, if not provided, may affect our ability to provide a personalised experience or tailored content or offerings.\\n \\n\\nWhat rights have I got in my state?\\nIn addition to the rights above, see California Consumer Privacy Rights for additional information.\\n\\n \\n\\nWithdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing\\nThe Adobe family of companies (see list of Adobe entities and our acquired companies) and companies we hire to help market our Services and Software on our behalf may use your information to provide you with information and offers related to Adobe. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhere we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your information for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time by:\\n\\n \\n\\nupdating your preferences in your Adobe ID profile;\\nupdating your preferences in your specific website or app accounts;\\nclicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails; or\\ncontacting us using the details provided at the end of this privacy policy.\\n \\n\\nClick here for further information on your choices regarding our marketing practices.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat information is collected by companies using Adobe Experience Cloud solutions?\\nAdobe Experience Cloud solutions help our business customers personalise and improve the performance of their websites, apps and marketing messages. For example, these customers may use Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to collect and analyse information about how individuals use their websites (learn more). The information collected is stored in our services on behalf of and for use by these business customers.\\n\\n \\n\\nHow long does Adobe retain my information?\\nWhen you register for an account and create an Adobe ID, we process and keep most personal information we process on your behalf for as long as you are an active user of our Services and Software. We delete certain personal information we collect about you when we no longer have a business reason to retain it. Additionally, there is some personal information we need to retain even after you close your account to comply with business and legal requirements, such as personal information related to our contract and business transactions with you, which we retain for ten years after your last interaction with us.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhere we process personal information for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the information until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a permanent record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your information so that we can respect your request in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nCan children use Adobe Services and Software?\\n\\nAdobe Services and Software are not intended for minors under the age of 13, except in limited situations where certain Creative and Document Cloud applications may be available to children for educational purposes under the direct supervision of a teacher or parent.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor more information about the collection and use of this and other student data (for students over the age of 13) please see the Adobe & Student Privacy page for more details.\\n\\n \\n\\nAdditionally, Adobe makes available a Privacy for Younger Users page to provide information for younger users of Adobe’s Services and Software (who are over 13 years of age) in an age appropriate format.\\n\\n \\n\\nAll other Adobe Services and Software are not intended for use by children and certain Services and Software specifically prohibit users who are under a certain age. If you do not meet applicable age requirements, please do not use those Services and Software.\\n \\n\\nWill this privacy policy change?\\nOccasionally, we may update this privacy policy (or other documents in the Adobe Privacy Centre) to allow Adobe to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. If we do, we will change the \"last updated\" date at the top of this policy and the revised policy will be posted to this page so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. We encourage you to periodically review the Adobe Privacy Centre for the latest information on our privacy practices. Under certain circumstances (for example with certain material changes or where it is required by applicable privacy laws) we will provide notice to you of these changes and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. Notice may be by email to you, by posting a notice of such changes on our Services and Software or by other means consistent with applicable law.\\n\\n \\n\\nWho can I contact with questions or concerns?\\nIf you have a privacy question, concern or request, please fill in a privacy enquiry form. \\n\\n \\n\\nIf you are outside North America, you can also get in touch with Adobe Ireland\\'s data protection officer at DPO@Adobe.com or by postal mail at 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Park, Dublin 24, Ireland.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor Marketo specific privacy questions, concerns or requests please contact us by email at privacyofficer@marketo.com.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor Magento specific privacy questions, concerns or requests please contact us by email at privacy@magento.com.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor Workfront specific privacy questions, concerns or requests please contact us by email at  privacy@workfront.com.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor Allegorithmic specific privacy questions, concerns or requests please contact us by email at privacy@allegorithmic.com. \\n\\n \\n\\nFor practices that are covered by our GDPR Validation or PRP Certification, please note that if you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily within 30 days, you may also keep in touch to our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.\\n\\n ', 1)\n",

You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use.

When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service.

It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.\\nImprove and develop our products.\\nPersonalize our products and make recommendations.\\nAdvertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.\\nWe also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.\\n\\nIn carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.\\n\\nOur processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies. This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.\\n\\nLearn more\\nTop of page\\nReasons we share personal data\\nWe share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized.

You may also provide us with access to your contacts (“Contacts”) to make it easy for you to do things like share and collaborate with others, send messages, and invite others to use the Services.

For example, we may collect the contact information of owners or employees of restaurants or other merchants on the Uber Eats, Cornershop or Postmates platforms; the contact information of individuals that manage and use accounts owned by Enterprise Customers; or data of individuals who start but do not complete their applications to be drivers or delivery persons.\\n\\nAll those subject to this notice are referred to as “users” in this notice.\\n\\nOur privacy practices are subject to applicable laws in the places in which we operate. This means that we engage in the practices described in this notice in a particular country or region only if permitted under the laws of those places.

Data provided by users. This includes:\\n\\nUser profile information: We collect data when users create or update their Uber accounts, or place orders via guest checkout features. This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), driver’s license and other government issued documents (which may include identification numbers as well as birth date, gender, and photo). This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers and delivery persons, emergency contact information, user settings, and evidence of health or fitness to provide services using Uber apps. \\nBackground check information (drivers and delivery persons): This includes information submitted during the driver/delivery person application process, such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), license status, known aliases, prior addresses, and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Uber’s behalf.\\nIdentity verification photos: This includes photos of users (such as, selfies) and/or their government issued identifications (such as, driver’s license or passports). Such photos may be used to verify a user’s identity, such as through facial verification technologies. Please see the section titled “How we use personal data” for more information regarding how user photos are used for safety and security purposes, including identity verification.\\nDemographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, such as birth date/age, gender or occupation, when required for certain Uber services or programs, such as Uber Cash, alcohol deliveries or safety features that allow women users to set a preference to provide or receive services to/from other women (“Women Rider Preference”).\\n\\nWe may also infer demographic data from other data collected from users. For example, we may infer a user’s gender based on their first name to enable safety features, such as the Women Rider Preference, or to display personalized ads for third party products or services. See the section titled “How we use personal data” below for more information.\\n\\nWe may also collect demographic data through user surveys.\\nUser content: We collect the data submitted by users when they contact Uber customer support (including at Uber Greenlight Hubs or via phone chat or video conferencing tools), provide ratings or feedback for other users, restaurants or merchants, or otherwise contact Uber. This may include photographs, or audio or video recordings submitted by users in connection with a customer support request. This also includes metadata relating to the method you use to communicate with Uber. The contents of photos and recordings submitted by users are subject to Uber’s Community Guidelines.\\n\\nIn certain jurisdictions, users can record the audio and/or video of their trips through an in-app feature or using a dashcam. In app recordings are encrypted and stored on users’ devices, and are only shared with Uber if submitted by the users in connection with safety incidents. Please see here for more information.\\nTravel information: We collect travel itinerary information, including times and dates of upcoming flight, lodging or car rental reservations, from users of our Uber Travel feature.

If so authorized, Uber will only access users’ Gmail accounts to collect travel itinerary information to enable the Uber Travel feature, and will adhere to Google’s API Services User Data Policy, including the limitations on use of data collected from users’ Gmail accounts.\\n2. Data created during use of our services. This includes: \\n\\nLocation data (driver and delivery person): We collect precise or approximate location data from drivers’ and delivery persons’ mobile devices when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen).\\nLocation data (riders and order recipients).

See “Choice and transparency” below for information on how riders and order recipients can enable precise location data collection.\\n\\nRiders and order recipients may use the Uber apps without enabling collection of location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect certain features in the Uber apps. For example, a rider who has not enabled precise location data will have to manually enter their pickup address.\\n\\nIn addition, precise location data collected from a driver’s device during a trip is linked to the rider’s account, even if the rider has not enabled precise location data to be collected from their device.

We may also use this feature for other verification purposes such as verifying change of bank account information or regaining account access.\\n\\nIn addition, we may use facial recognition technology to process user profile photographs, identification photographs, or other user-submitted photographs to prevent identity-borrowing or use of our services by unauthorized drivers or delivery people.\\n\\nWe may also use selfies to verify that users are wearing masks, helmets or other safety gear through the use of object verification technology.\\n\\nIn some countries, riders may be required to verify their identity to use cash and certain other payment methods. In such cases, Uber allows riders to provide their ID number and/or a photo of their identification card to complete such verifications.

We also use data from delivery persons’ devices to verify the type of vehicles they used to provide deliveries.\\nusing driver location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud.

To object to such a deactivation, please contact Uber customer support.\\nusing user ratings, reported incidents, and other feedback to encourage compliance with our Community Guidelines and as grounds for deactivating users with low ratings or who otherwise violated such guidelines in certain countries. In the European Union or where otherwise required by law, such deactivation occurs only after human review and/or the possibility to appeal. For more information about how ratings are determined and used, please see here for rider ratings, here for driver ratings, and here for delivery person ratings. To object to such a deactivation, please contact Uber customer support.\\nusing driver data (such as location, ratings and gender where legally permitted) and rider data (such as ratings, origin and destination) to predict and help avoid pairings of users that may result in increased risk of conflict (for instance, because one user previously gave the other a one-star rating).\\nsharing user name, location, phone number, vehicle details and other relevant information with third-party companies that support the management and de-escalation of interpersonal conflicts that may occur between users while on a trip or in the process of making a delivery.\\n\\nUber performs the above activities on the grounds that they are necessary to fulfill the terms of our agreements with users, and/or for purposes of the legitimate safety and security interests of Uber, our users and members of the general public.\\n3.

And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\n\\n\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\n\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\n\\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using.

If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\\n\\nYour activity\\n\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.

And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\n\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.

And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\n\\nDevelop new services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\n\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\n\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\n\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\n\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\n\\nGo to My Ad Center\\n\\nMeasure performance\\n\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\n\\nCommunicate with you\\n\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\n\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\n\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\n\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\n\\nWe may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\n\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\n\\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\n\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\n\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account.

We may request your consent for this transfer or the transfer, in other cases, may be justified by a legal basis other than consent.\\n\\n9. Automated Processing\\nWe may use some automated processing to provide our Services and to make recommendations in the context of specific services. This processing is strictly necessary for providing certain Services (and, in some cases, is the service itself) and is not covered by consent. Other automated processing is not significant either due to the nature of the data or the decisions being made or recommended, and so consent is not required. However, for automated processing that is significant and related to sensitive Personal Data, prior to sharing or using such data, we will first seek your consent. For the subset of automated processing included in ad profiling for ad targeting, you can change your consent status (for website services) by turning advertising cookies off as outlined in in our cookie and device id use section. For mobile apps, you can change your consent status by activating your Limit Ad Tracking or equivalent setting as described in our cookie and device id use section.\\n\\n10. To Enable Social Sharing and Connect with Us on Social Media\\nOur Services consist of social sharing and communication with others. If you sign up for these Services, we may ask for your consent to use your information to enable sharing as described in the Service. We may also ask for your consent when you connect with us through Social Media.\\n\\n11. Promotions\\nWe may ask you for permission to use your Personal Data and Fitness and Wellness Data for special offers, events, sweepstakes, and other Promotions. We may use the Personal Data we collect during Promotions, to administer the Promotion, verify identity and age, and to communicate with you about the Promotion.\\n\\nSocial Sharing Settings\\nWithin our Services there are four sharing settings: Private, Public, Friends Only, and Locked with a Key. MyFitnessPal is designed to help you along your fitness and wellness journey. As such, you are able to control what Personal Data you share and with whom you share it. We encourage you to adjust the sharing settings to best meet your objectives and sharing comfort level. In the interest of safeguarding your Personal Data, we have outlined some initial default sharing settings.\\n\\nDefault Sharing Settings\\n“Physical Stats,” “Diary” and “Community Social Data” are set as Private. “Private” means not shared with friends or other members. You can change this default status for some of your physical stats. Information that is “Private” by default includes, for example, your height, weight and BMI.\\n\\n“Activity” is set as  Friends Only. “Friends Only” means visible to your friends in their news feed, but not shared with other members. You can change this default status if you want. Information that is set as “Friends Only” by default includes, for example, your friendships, news feed comments, completed food diaries, and workouts completed.\\n\\n“Forum Posts” are Public. “Public” means visible to all others using the service.\\n\\nLookup Information (“Let my friends find me” and “Profile”) are set as Public. “Let my friends find me” allows people to see that you are on MyFitnessPal and easily add you as a friend (i.e., your account is discoverable by email address). We believe that social motivation helps you achieve your goals faster and allowing your friends to be able to find you is crucial to this experience. “Profile” information and picture is visible only to MyFitnessPal members who are logged in (age is Private on a member’s profile by default). If you set your entire account as Private, your lookup information will no longer be available for your friends to find you (unless you otherwise indicate that desire within the Services).\\n\\nChanging Your Sharing Preferences\\nDetails on how to update your sharing preferences and the default settings for our Services are outlined within the sharing standard.\\n\\nNote: When you share information from our Services externally with a SNS, the information you post is governed by their privacy policy and settings.\\n\\nInterest-Based Advertising\\nInterest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or apps. Our advertising practices also include the creation and use of “audience segments.” You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads. Depending on where you access our website from, you may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies. Additional information on Audience Segments and our choices for interest- based advertising is found below.\\n\\nAudience Segments. We disclose various types of information for purposes of interest-based advertising, including for third party, interest-based advertising. This processing includes the use of Personal Data to create audience segments. These audience segments are then made available for interest-based advertising, including for third party advertising, on MyFitnessPal online properties. The audience segments are based on website visits, app usage data, Fitness and Wellness Data, online and offline purchasing behaviors, interaction with our ads or marketing emails, similar types of information, and in some cases, data from third parties.\\n\\nUnited States Note: The audience segments are made available for interest-based advertising for third party advertising on the MyFitnessPal Services.\\n\\nInterest-Based Advertising Opt Outs, Choices, and Control. For all of the interest-based advertising described above, including segments, you have the choice to not have your data used to target and serve you interest-based advertising-including third party advertising-regardless of where such ads might be served. These opt-outs require that strictly necessary cookies are not blocked by the settings in your web browser. We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the digital advertising alliance in the US, the canadian digital advertising alliance in Canada, and the european digital advertising alliance in the EU. If you live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can visit ad choices (US), your ad choices (Canada), or your online choices (EU) to find a convenient place to opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities for each region. These websites also provide detailed information about how interest-based advertising works. Opting out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising from us, or when you use the Internet. It just means that the data collected from our website will not be used for interest-based advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on websites will not be customized to your interests. Mobile App. You may opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices by activating the “Limit Ad Tracking” or equivalent feature offered by your mobile platform. It will transmit a signal to us and to third-parties that indicates your data should not be used for interest-based advertising.\\n\\nOur cookie and device id use section provides additional options for controlling the use of particular kinds of cookies, including advertising cookies. You may use our “advertising cookies” toggle in these settings to prohibit the collection and use of Personal Data in cookies for interest-based advertising.\\n\\nManaging Preferences and Withdrawing Consent\\nYou may at any time withdraw your consent with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other controls regarding website and online data collection, interest-based advertising, your communication settings, and app preferences. Collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to work.\\n\\nWe provide you several ways to manage your preferences:\\n\\nCookie Use and Controls\\nCookies serve a wide variety of purposes. Cookies are pieces of data stored in your web browser that are transmitted to websites to remember your browser over time and distinguish it from other users. Cookies are used to personalize your web experience and for security, analytics, marketing, and interest-based advertising. Our cookies are placed and read by our web servers, while other cookies are placed and read by other companies’ web servers. Information on specific cookies is found on our website via the adchoices link. You can block and control cookies using the information noted in this section. If you block all cookies, certain functionality on our Website will not work.\\n\\nOne way to think about cookies is based on their function. The following settings will control our use of browser cookies, the use of IP address for tracking, and the collection and use of data for cookie-based, interest-based advertising.\\n\\n[ IN ] Required Cookies. These strictly necessary cookies are used for core functionality, and recognize when you are signed in, are necessary for security, and enforce your privacy preferences. Without these cookies, some functionality on our Website may fail. You can block these cookies in your browser preferences.\\n\\n[ IN / OUT ] Functional Cookies. These cookies help to improve the Website by allowing us to understand how the Website is used and how the Website performs. These cookies include analytics and measurement.\\n\\n[ IN / OUT ] Advertising Cookies. These cookies help us and other parties personalize ads that are shown to you on the Services, as well as on other websites. If enabled, these cookies will allow third parties engaged in interest-based advertising on our Website to recognize your browser software on other websites too.\\n\\nIP Address Use\\nAn IP address refers to an identifier assigned by a network to a computer, mobile device, Internet of Things (IoT) device, or routing device. IP addresses, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, include “public” IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that is visible to the Internet, as well as “local” IP addresses, which are IP addresses assigned to computers and mobile devices “behind” a router (such as a home router). Our advertising and analytics partners may use IP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics, security and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad targeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency.\\n\\nYou can choose not to have IP address used for purposes of advertising or analytics by using the cookie controls for “Advertising Cookies,” and “Performance/Analytics,” above.\\n\\nWeb Pixels or Beacons Use\\nPixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web browser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party corresponding to the pixel. If that party’s cookies are currently stored in your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request. Beacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the opening of a marketing email. When used in conjunction with cookies for interest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to control the purpose for which they are used.\\n\\nHTML5 Local Storage\\nHTML5 Local Storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be used for the same purpose (to pair a tracking ID to a particular web server with your web browser so that the web server can identify your web browser over time). You can control the purpose for which HTML5 Local Storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above.\\n\\nSocial Network Interaction and Widgets\\nSocial network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our Website passively transmit data regarding a social network’s members to that social network, even when a button is not clicked. These technologies may allow a social network (e.g., Facebook) to personally identify its members and to know the web pages its members have visited. This is true wherever social network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is “clicked” or “pressed.” If you belong to a social network or use these categories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect and what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is collected and used. If you disable advertising cookies, the passive tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.\\n\\nMobile Device Advertising IDs, Location, Sensor Data, and In-Range Device Data Use\\nOur Services may transmit Device IDs, general location data, and data from sensors to us and our partners, including our advertising partners.\\n\\nDevice IDs include IDs associated with your mobile device carrier such as IMEI, MEID, IMSI; platform-specific IDs such as Android ID, Google AID, and Apple’s IDFA; and IDs that are part of your device hardware, such as WiFi MAC address, and serial number. Exactly which Device IDs are transmitted can depend on your mobile device platform and the version of your operating system.\\n\\nGeneral Location Data. Our Services may transmit general location data. General location data may be obtained from GPS services, cell tower triangulation, or known location of nearby WiFi access points.\\n\\nSensor and In-Range Device Data. Our apps and Services may also collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSIDs) from other, in-range or networked devices and WiFi Access Points.\\n\\nHow We Use Mobile Device Data. We may use Device IDs, coarse location and general location data, and data from sensors, including the local network, (together with app usage data and Fitness and Wellness Data) for strictly necessary purposes; improving our apps and analytics; personalization and preferences; and cross-app, cross-device, interest-based advertising.\\n\\nWithdraw Your Consent for Use of Your Mobile Device IDs for Analytics and Advertising\\nActivating the “Limit Ad Tracking,” “Opt out of Ads Personalization,” or equivalent setting from your mobile device will transmit a signal to us and any third parties that we use. When that signal is received by MyFitnessPal or third parties, it communicates your choice to not have Device IDs used for purposes of advertising or analytics. We honor the signal and require that our third party advertising and analytics partners do the same.\\n\\nTo the extent our App personalizes functionality for you, you can change these settings within the App, or reset to defaults by deleting and reinstalling the App.\\n\\nChange Consent Settings for Communication Preferences\\nConsent for Email Communication: After signing up for email communications, you can choose to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link in any commercial email we send. Please note that if you unsubscribe from “all emails” this means “all emails other than strictly necessary emails.” You will still receive email communications from us if they are strictly necessary to provide the Services or to confirm or validate a transaction, recover accounts, etc.\\n\\nMobile Push Notifications: You can manage the type of push notifications you receive from MyFitnessPal by modifying the settings within the App. For more information on how to update your push notification settings for our Services please visit here.

For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.\\n\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\n\\n\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\n\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\n\\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\n\\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\n\\nThings you create or provide to us\\n\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\n\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\n\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\n\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\n\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\n\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\\n\\nYour activity\\n\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\n\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\n\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\\n\\n\\nGo to Google Account\\n\\nYour location information\\n\\nWe collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location.\\n\\nYour location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:\\n\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\n\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\n\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\n\\n\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\n\\nProvide our services\\n\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\n\\nMaintain & improve our services\\n\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\n\\nDevelop new services\\n\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\n\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\n\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\n\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\n\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\n\\nGo to My Ad Center\\n\\nMeasure performance\\n\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\n\\nCommunicate with you\\n\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\n\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\n\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\n\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\n\\nWe may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\n\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\n\\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\n\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\n\\n\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\n\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\\n\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\n\\nPrivacy controls\\n\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off.
